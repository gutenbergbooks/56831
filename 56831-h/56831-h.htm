</div>

<p>Police Sergeant Hardy stood near the
Boylston Street entrance to the Fens, his back
toward the hundred and fifteen acres of park
land which it was his duty to guard, his good-natured
face overspread by a smile, as he
watched a young lady taking a bicycle lesson
in a secluded walk on his left.</p>

<p>The young lady approached the machine
held by her instructor as if it were a horse,
then springing nimbly on it, her features became
rigid with anxiety as she found that her
steed would neither go on nor stand still.</p>

<p>Her heroic grapplings and wrestlings with
it, her wild gyrations to and fro in the walk,
while her teacher dashed madly after her, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
so ludicrous that the sergeant, although he
was well used to such spectacles, was obliged
to turn away to conceal the broad grin that
overspread his countenance.</p>

<p>The next object of his attention was a Gordon
setter who was gayly trotting into the
park, but who, on catching the sergeant’s eye,
at once changed his happy-go-lucky demeanor
for a guilty shambling gait.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here, Mr. Ormistead’s
dog?” said the sergeant in a stern voice, as
he glanced at the animal’s collar. “Where’s
your escort?”</p>

<p>The setter immediately prostrated himself on
the ground, but his humble attitude was belied
by the roguish don’t-care expression of the eyes
he rolled up at the guardian of the law.</p>

<p>The sergeant waved his hand at him. “Get
home with you. You know you can’t run
loose here. What would the ducks and the
cats say to you; or rather, what would you
say to them?”</p>

<p>The dog was not ready to give in. He
extended the tip of a very pink tongue, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
meekly licked the tip of the sergeant’s shiny
boot.</p>

<p>“No nonsense now,” said the man firmly.
“You can’t humbug me, and you understand
that as well as a Christian. Run home with
you.”</p>

<p>The dog sprang up, resumed his careless air,
and trotted calmly from the park by the roadway
through which he had come.</p>

<p>The sergeant sauntered on. It was a charming
September morning. He met a few pedestrians
and many nurses and children. It was
yet rather early in the day for the carriage
people to be out.</p>

<p>A succession of angry childish shrieks made
him suddenly wheel round, and look in the
direction from which he had come. Two
nurses and two children stood by the stone
seats near the group of bronze figures erected
to the memory of John Boyle O’Reilly.</p>

<p>The sergeant strolled slowly back to them.
One of the nurses bent over a little girl who
was sobbing violently, and was stamping her
foot at a foreign-looking lad with a pale face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
who stood at a little distance from her. His
nurse, or attendant, for he was rather too old
a child to come entirely under a nursery <i>régime</i>,
supported him by her presence, and would
have taken his hand in hers if he had not
drawn it from her.</p>

<p>“And sure you’ve hurt her this time with
your murderin’ Frenchy temper,” exclaimed
the little girl’s nurse, looking away from her
sobbing charge at the silent boy. “It’s a
batein’ you ought to have. Come now, tell us
what you were after a-doing to her?”</p>

<p>“He took me by the arm and the leg, and
he sweeped the ground with me,” cried the
little girl peeping at him from between her
fingers.</p>

<p>“Och, the young villain,” interrupted her
nurse, “and did you?”</p>

<p>The boy shrugged his shoulders. “Yes, it
is true; but afterwards embraced her.”</p>

<p>“By the soul of love, but you’re the queer
boy,” responded the nurse warmly; “and it’s
the likes of you makes the men that thinks
they can drag us women round the earth by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the hair of our heads, and then make it up with
a—I’m sorry for ye, me dear—Bad luck
to ye.”</p>

<p>“Hush now, Bridget,” interposed the second
nurse, stepping nearer the boy. “Wait till you
hear the rights of this. Tell us now, Master
Eugene, what did Virgie do to you?”</p>

<p>The boy’s eyes flashed; but he said quietly
enough, “Would you have me a talebearer?
What would my grandfather say? Ask the
child”—and he pointed to the still sobbing
Virgie with as grand an air as if he were really
the man that he felt himself to be.</p>

<p>“He h-h-hurt my pealings,” wailed Virgie
dismally.</p>

<p>“Your pealings; it’s feelings you mean, rose
of my heart,” said her nurse, drawing the child
nearer to her. “Tell your good Bridget what
you did to the naughty boy.”</p>

<p>The little girl, for some reason or other, was
shy about confessing the provocation that she
had given her playmate; but her nurse, whose
curiosity had been aroused, was determined to
extract a confession from her, and adroitly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
made use of the presence of the sergeant, who
had by this time arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>“See, lovie dove,” she murmured in the
child’s ear, “here’s a great big monster of a
policeman, and he’s looking at ye. Tell him
sharp.”</p>

<p>The little girl shuddered, hid her face in
her nurse’s breast, and whispered, “I ’sulted
his remperor.”</p>

<p>“And you served him right,” said Bridget.
“The grasping old frog-eater. If I had a child
that worshipped his bones, it’s shutting him
up in prison I’d be after doing till he learned
better sense,” and she made a vindictive gesture
in Eugene’s direction.</p>

<p>Her nurse’s championship restored courage
to the breast of the little girl; and slipping
from her knee, she jumped nimbly to the stone
seat beside them, and stretched out both her
tiny hands toward the noble head carved above
her.</p>

<p>“I ’sulted him,” she cried, tossing back her
curls from her flushed rosy cheeks. “I made
a face at him like this,” and she screwed up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
her little visage in a detestable grimace, “and
I said, ‘Eugene, I hate your old remperor;’
then he sweeped me over the ground.”</p>

<p>A slight flush overspread the boy’s pale face,
but he did not deny the accusation.</p>

<p>“Well, now, Virgie Manning,” said the boy’s
nurse in a severe manner, “that was real
mean in you. You’re only a little girl, but
you ought to be ashamed of yourself to taunt
a little boy that sets such store by his emperor.
Look at here, officer,” and she appealed
to the sergeant; “you’ve often seen us in these
Fens. This little boy,” and she pointed to
Eugene, “is French, and he’s got such a love
for foreign things that you can’t get it out of
him. He justs worships the emperor. I don’t
rightly know which one it was”—</p>

<p>“His majesty, the great Napoleon, the
greatest emperor the world has ever seen,”
murmured the boy, lifting his cap with an indescribable
mingling of reverence and grace.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t any brothers or sisters or father
or mother,” continued the nurse, “and his
grandfather’s nearly always away; and ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
since he was a little fellow he tells me he’s
been used to taking his meals with the picture
of this emperor propped against the sugar-bowl;
and he declares that this statoo, or figger, or
whatever you call it, is like the photograph,
and he just worships it; and if he sees any
one leaning against this slab, or throwing
stones near it, it just makes him crazy; and
Virgie knows it, and she does it to tease him;
and it ain’t his fault if he struck her or whatever
he did,” and the girl threw a glance of
defiance at the other nurse.</p>

<p>The sergeant smiled amiably. Among his
multifarious duties he was quite well accustomed
to being called on to act as arbiter in
disputes between young nursery-maids or between
their charges; and being somewhat of a
philosopher, he was well adapted for the office.</p>

<p>The first thing he usually did was to give
the parties engaged in controversy time to get
cool while he went off on a side issue; so he
said, in a deliberate fashion, “According to my
humble opinion, if I was called upon suddenly
for it, I should say that there isn’t much resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
between John Boyle O’Reilly and
the great Bonaparte. In the first place, O’Reilly
never used a razor on his upper lip; and I guess
the great Bonaparte did, judging by his pictures.
How do you get over that, son?” and
he directed his attention to the small boy in a
paternal way.</p>

<p>Eugene looked up adoringly at the silent
face above them, and spoke in a choking voice.
“I have talked over the affair with Monsieur
my grandfather. He agrees with me that there
is a slight resemblance. Perhaps after the
noble martyr went to St. Helena he was not
allowed the use of a razor. Those abominable
English”—</p>

<p>His utterance failed him to such a degree
that the sergeant stared curiously at him.
Was it possible that this small boy was shaken
with emotion over the sufferings of the ambitious
and despotic arbiter of men’s destinies
who was so long since dead?</p>

<p>Yes, it was—the boy was in earnest.</p>

<p>“Do you believe in my emperor?” he asked,
turning seriously to the sergeant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said the officer dryly.
“I owe my allegiance, as I suppose you’d call
it, to our President, to the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and to the great American
Union. However, I can say I believe in Napoleon
to this extent—I believe he lived.”</p>

<p>“If you insult him,” said the boy gravely,
“you are my enemy. I worship him. Long
live the emperor—his memory will never die;”
and his lips moved softly while he again lifted
his little cap from his head.</p>

<p>The sergeant said nothing, but glanced at
the two nurses, who had forgotten their dispute
and were chatting amiably.</p>

<p>“Come, Master Eugene,” said his nurse, “we
must be going.”</p>

<p>The sergeant stepped back; and the little
girl, who had been jealously watching him
while he talked to Eugene, took his place.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I made naughty faces at your
remperor,” she said poutingly. “Kiss me, Eugene.”</p>

<p>The boy did not kiss her, and he made no
apologies for his own conduct. “I pardon you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>”
he said calmly; and he dropped the pink fingers
that she extended to him. “Will you have
the kindness to promenade with your nurse? I
wish to talk to this gentleman—if I am permitted;”
and he turned to the sergeant, who
was furiously gnawing his mustache to keep
from laughing at the boy’s grown-up air.</p>

<p>The two nurses and the little girl strolled
on ahead, while the sergeant and the boy followed
them.</p>

<p>Eugene had recovered his composure. “What
admirable weather,” he said, dreamily watching
the fleecy clouds floating across the blue sky.
“I am glad that my grandfather says I am
to stay out-of-doors all the time, and not go
to school.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t your grandfather believe in
schools?” asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Officer, not in the kind you have
here,” said the boy wearily. “This is what it
was like—I had my breakfast, and went to a
hot room where boys and girls sat in rows.
I bent over books for an hour or two, then
there was a play-time for a few minutes only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
after it more study until lunch-time. A few
hurried mouthfuls of food I got at home, then
I was running back to the school. By half-past
three I was too languid to play, and would
try to get my lessons for the next day. My
head would ache, and I would go to bed. I
tell you,” and the boy confronted his companion
in sudden passion, “your schools are
infamous. They should be abolished. I wish
I were an emperor, or your Mr. President. I
would guillotine the school-teachers.”</p>

<p>“You’re an odd one,” muttered the sergeant
to himself, as he cast a side glance at the slim,
elegant figure of the boy beside him. “With
your flashes of anger, and your quiet dull way
like an old man, you’re like a queer combination
lock. It isn’t every one that can pick
you open.”</p>

<p>Aloud he said, “This is a free country, my
boy; yet I fear you’ll get yourself into trouble
some day if you keep up your little amusement
of sweeping up the ground with girls, and if
you propose to kill off our teachers. Why,
they’re the staff of the nation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>“What I say may sound harsh for the instant,”
said the boy mildly, “but reflect for a
little. Is it not better for a few to suffer than
for many? Your schools must kill thousands
of children. If a few teachers were sacrificed,
many boys would be saved for military duty.
Otherwise they will waste their strength in
this imbecile of a life, or die, as I say.”</p>

<p>“How do you suppose the teachers would
feel to be killed off?” asked the sergeant, his
broad shoulders shaking with laughter.</p>

<p>Eugene made a compassionate gesture. “It
would not be pleasant for them. Perhaps one
could alter the punishment to banishment for
life.”</p>

<p>“Why not allow them to stay at home, if
they promise to stop teaching, or to use shorter
hours?”</p>

<p>“Because a teacher will always teach, even
as women and priests will always intrigue,”
said Eugene firmly. “My grandfather says so.”</p>

<p>The sergeant turned his puzzled face up to
the poplars overhead. “I’ve seen a good many
boys and girls in my time, young Frenchman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>”
he observed slowly, “but I’m blest if I ever
saw one with such twisted ideas as you’ve got.
Why, you ought to be made over again. Is it
your grandfather who has brought you up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Officer.”</p>

<p>“Who is he, anyway?”</p>

<p>“He is called Monsieur le Comte Eugène
Claude Louis Hernando de Vargas, formerly
seigneur of the château of Châtillon-sur-Loir
in the department of Loir-et-Cher in France;
and he is descended from the Spaniard Hernando
de Vargas, who was ennobled and made
a marshal of France by the great Napoleon.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the sergeant, “I see why you’re
so stuffy; and where does your grandfather
live in this democratic city of Boston?”</p>

<p>“Yonder,” said the boy, with a wave of his
hand toward the south. “We have but small
quarters. My grandfather is embarrassed in his
affairs. I may tell you as an official, though I
would never tell the schoolboys, that he was
sentenced to banishment for conspiring against
the abominable so-called republic of France.”</p>

<p>“Abominable and republic,” repeated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
sergeant remonstratingly; “come, boy, that’s
not grateful. Do you forget that a republican
flag is waving over you at this present
moment?”</p>

<p>“For you it is well,” said the boy earnestly.
“You are true to the past. You defied England,
who would have made slaves of you.
Also, you have had no emperor.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of George Washington
and Abraham Lincoln?” asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>“The names of those gentlemen are quite
unknown to me,” said Eugene politely.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that you have never
heard of that wonderful hatchet?”</p>

<p>“Whose hatchet, Mr. Officer?”</p>

<p>“George Washington’s.”</p>

<p>“A hatchet is a kind of sword, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,—it is a chopper; we cut up
wood and meat and anything with it. You’ve
heard that story surely.”</p>

<p>“Possibly, sir,” said Eugene indifferently.
“I do not remember that I have.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m dumb,” said the sergeant. “I
didn’t think there was a child in the length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and breadth of America that hadn’t heard
about that hatchet. Can you tell a lie, then,
as you don’t know about George Washington?”</p>

<p>“In general,” said Eugene, in his grave, old-fashioned
way, “I do not tell lies. At times,
if I consider one better than the truth, I tell
it without scruple.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think it’s wrong to lie?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; truth is often tiresome; there is
tedium in it, my grandfather says. The great
emperor lied.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet anything on that,” said the sergeant
grimly, “and he didn’t get any good by
it either, nor will you, my boy; but of that
more anon, as Shakespeare says. I’ll have to
talk to you some time about those two gentlemen,
as you call them, that you don’t know
about. Would you like me to do so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I should be charmed.”</p>

<p>“I’ll back up Washington and Lincoln
against all the emperors that ever lived,” said
the sergeant. “There, now, don’t get huffy.”</p>

<p>“I am not vexed,” said Eugene quietly. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
am only about to ask you if you can tell me
the name of the first king of France.”</p>

<p>The sergeant knitted his brows. “Louis,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Officer, it was Clovis. Can you
tell me why Saint Louis gained his name?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the sergeant gruffly; “I’m not up
in French history.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard of the fight at the circus
between Pepin the Little and the beasts?”
asked Eugene softly and mischievously.</p>

<p>The sergeant laughed good-naturedly.
“You’ve caught me, small boy. I don’t know
any more of French history than you do of
American. We’ll cry quits. What street did
you say you lived on?”</p>

<p>“Lovejoy Street, number 29, suite 4—you
will not proceed against my grandfather?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed; I just want to know where you
live. I thought by the way you talk your
grandfather must have a mansion on Commonwealth
Avenue, at least.”</p>

<p>“No, he has not; but the little girl who insulted
my emperor lives there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you ever go to her house?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the boy carelessly. “Our nurses
are friends, and we promenade together. I do
not care for girls. I like men. May I count
you as one of my friends, sir?” and stopping
himself quickly by sticking the heels of his
shoes in the ground, he made the sergeant a
low bow.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’ll be delighted,” said the sergeant,
grinning at him.</p>

<p>“And may I request the honor of your
name,” pursued the boy. “My grandfather
will ask me”—</p>

<p>“Stephen Hardy, at your service, sir—plain
Stephen Hardy, no marshals nor lords, not even
a captain in my string—only plain Yankee
sailors for grandfathers.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you belong to the <i>bourgeoisie</i>,” said
Eugene, “or possibly the <i>peuple</i>. I should be
more pleased if you had the <i>particule</i> before
your name. De Hardy would be better. However,
in this country one must let that pass.
You are, nevertheless, not a peasant. One
can see that by your bearing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s your grandfather’s business?” asked
the sergeant bluntly.</p>

<p>The boy blushed a furious crimson. “In
this country he has no friends, no influence,
his property was taken away—at present he
assists a countryman in”—</p>

<p>“In teaching French?” asked the sergeant
kindly.</p>

<p>“No; we speak but few words of French,”
said the boy, and he looked as if another one
of his fits of passion were about to come upon
him. “We use your language in order that
we may not be laughed at, as the boys laugh
at me when I speak French.”</p>

<p>“How long have you been in this country?”
asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Six months, Mr. Officer.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ve got a pretty remarkable hold
of English for that time.”</p>

<p>“But I had an English nurse when I was
a child, and an English tutor later on. It
was the custom among the <i>noblesse</i>.”</p>

<p>“And what does your grandfather do?”
asked the sergeant, coming back to his original
question with true Yankee pertinacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pardon me, sir—I will tell you another
day,” said the boy irritably. “The words
stick in my throat. I have the honor to wish
you good-morning;” and with another one of
his sweeping bows, he swiftly and gracefully
left the sergeant, and hurried after the two
nurses and the little girl, who were making
their way toward the wide expanse of meadows
and shrub-planted slopes at the farther end of
the Fens.</p>

<p>The sergeant stared after Eugene, and talked
aloud to himself, as he had a habit of doing.
“I don’t rightly make out that lad yet. We
haven’t got any like him in this country.
Haughty isn’t the word for him, and selfish
doesn’t come anywhere near his looking out
for number one; yet there’s something diverting
about the little shaver, in spite of it all.
He’s old-fashioned, like a child that’s been
brought up with elderly people. I’ll look out
for him. He’ll be coming here again,” and
the sergeant smiled to himself as he went on
his rounds through the park.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="small">KING BOOZY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The next morning, while Sergeant Hardy
was standing near the main entrance to the
Fens on Commonwealth Avenue, he was glad
to see in the distance the figures of the two
nurses and their two charges.</p>

<p>Eugene, holding himself as straight as a dart,
was a little in advance of the others; while
Virgie frisked around him, first on one side
and then on the other, and occasionally paused
to throw back a few words to the nurses, whose
heads were nodding in busy conversation.</p>

<p>The sergeant was glad to see that Eugene
looked happier than he had done the day before.
Indeed, he was comparatively cheerful
this morning; and when he got near the sergeant,
his cap came off his head in a twinkling,
and he said gayly, “Good-morning, sir.”</p>

<p>“Bong zhoor, musso,” said the sergeant, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
rather indifferent French. “You look as
pleased as if you’d got a freedom suit.”</p>

<p>Eugene’s curiosity was piqued. “Will you
explain, sir?” he said prettily. “You mention
a phrase that I have never met before.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the sergeant, planting himself
in the middle of the pavement, while the nurses
and the children stood round him in respectful
attention, “long ago, when I was a young man,
I lived in the country. Every lad, when he
was twenty-one, used to get a suit of new
clothes, a dress-suit and a tall hat, which he
called a freedom suit. This suit was kept for
special occasions, like going to church, and funerals,
and weddings, and making calls on our
lady friends. I can just see the young fellows
riding in from the farms on horseback, proud
as Punch, with their coat-tails tucked in their
pockets to keep them clean.”</p>

<p>“How droll!” said Eugene.</p>

<p>“How droll!” little Virgie repeated after
him.</p>

<p>“I will walk with you, sir,” said the boy,
when the sergeant turned in the direction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the park. “And I will walk wif you,” lisped
Virgie to Eugene, attempting to take his hand.</p>

<p>“Not so,” he said decidedly; and he held
both hands before him. “It might occur to
you to seize these flowers which I am carrying,
especially as they are for the emperor.”</p>

<p>The sergeant’s eyes wandered curiously
from the tiny bunch of violets to the plain,
almost threadbare, suit of clothes that the boy
wore. Something told him that Eugene’s
scanty savings were heroically devoted to perpetuating
the memory of his beloved emperor.</p>

<p>“Are you going to lay those before John
Boyle O’Reilly,” he asked.</p>

<p>Eugene bowed gravely.</p>

<p>“Speaking of monuments, there is one I admire,”
said the sergeant, jerking a thumb over
his shoulder; “and I often think it shows
that a woman knows better how to dress a
man than a man does.”</p>

<p>“You have reason,” said Eugene courteously;
though he did not understand in the least what
the sergeant meant, and the sergeant knew he
did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look at it,” said the man to his young
companion; and then they both turned around.</p>

<p>Against the blue sky rose alert and graceful
the bronze figure of Leif Ericsson, the Norse
discoverer of America. One hand he held to
his forehead. He was peering forward, as if
his eager eyes were anxious to discover the
wonders of the new world.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the sergeant, “it is a woman
that made that, and to my mind she made a
man. I get tired of these heroes in petticoats,
sitting round on monuments. I never saw a
man in petticoats in my life, except a Christian
brother; yet when any one of our famous
men is going to be put up in stone for us to
admire, the sculptor swaddles him round like
a baby in long clothes; though Boston isn’t
as bad in this respect as some of our cities.”</p>

<p>“It is a thousand pities,” said Eugene absently.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you leave those flowers with
Leif?” asked the sergeant jokingly.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_024a.jpg" alt="Sergeant" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="smcap small">“Let Me put Them up for You,” said the Sergeant.</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Eugene immediately awaked out of his revery.
“No, no,” he said; and he hurried on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
with a disturbed face, and scarcely spoke until
they reached the bronze monument.</p>

<p>“Let me put them up for you,” said the
sergeant, when Eugene stood on tiptoe, and
tried to toss his violets near O’Reilly’s face.</p>

<p>The boy gave them up, and anxiously watched
him as he deposited them on the stone ledge on
which the bust rested.</p>

<p>“I wish O’Reilly could see you,” said the
sergeant. “Perhaps he does. He was a patriot,
and I guess he would approve of your
devotion to your country.”</p>

<p>Eugene stood gazing up in rapt attention until
Virgie and the two nurses arrived; then he
sighed, and brought his eyes to the earth again.</p>

<p>“I fought you’d runned away and hid yoursef,”
said little Virgie, shaking her curls and
dancing up to Eugene. “Come play wif me;
I’m all lonesome.”</p>

<p>Eugene was about yielding passively to her
request, when he caught sight of a little head
peering at him from the underbrush near by.</p>

<p>“Ah, Jacobin!” he said calmly, as he stooped
and seized a stone, “away with thee.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The stone was not thrown; for the sergeant
stepped forward, and seized him by the shoulder.
“What do you see, boy?” he asked.</p>

<p>“A cat,” replied Eugene.</p>

<p>The sergeant retained his hold of Eugene,
and sat him down on the stone seat. “Boy,”
he said firmly, “do you stone cats?”</p>

<p>“Always,” returned Eugene. “The reptiles!”</p>

<p>“Why do you do it?”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” said the lad with slight sarcasm,
“you would also stone them if you lived where
we do. At night my grandfather retires worn
out by his exertions during the day. He sleeps;
then he springs from his bed, awakened by a
cry for help from a drowning child. It is a
cat! He becomes angry; he lifts the window,
and throws a morsel of coal at the supposed
drowning one. He again retires. He again
sleeps. This time a woman shrieks from a
burning house. He again hurls himself from
the bed. Once more it is but a cat. He
throws two morsels of coal, and ensconces himself
between the blankets. In succession he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
aroused by murderers, by burglars, by a chorus
of men’s voices, by a famous <i>prima donna</i>;
and all is produced by those wretches of cats.
He says that he has travelled in many lands,
and that he has heard the voices of many cats;
but for maliciousness and range of tones these
Boston cats eclipse all others.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what your grandfather takes for
supper,” said the sergeant sternly. “A man
that runs down cats and women and priests
ain’t fit to live, in my estimation.”</p>

<p>Eugene promptly raised a little cane that he
carried under his arm, and struck the sergeant
a smart blow across his legs.</p>

<p>The sergeant in his amazement released his
hold of Eugene’s shoulder; and his nurse, stepping
forward with a dismayed face, interposed
herself between the angry lad and his powerful
opponent, and said, “Run, Master Eugene,
run.”</p>

<p>“I will not run,” said the boy haughtily.
“You, sir,” he went on, addressing the sergeant,
“shall give me satisfaction for this some day.
I challenge you to fight a duel with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>All the annoyance died out of the sergeant’s
face. “You young swaggerer,” he said with
a short laugh, “you’ve got a hard row to
hoe in this life. I’m sorry for you; but I
guess I’d no business to run down your grandfather.
Come over here now; I want to show
you something. You come too,” he added,
addressing the nurses and little Virgie, who
had timidly retreated when Eugene began to
get angry.</p>

<p>Eugene somewhat sulkily accepted his apology,
and they all followed him; while the sergeant
talked to them over his shoulder, and
led the way to a path near the Boylston-street
bridge.</p>

<p>“Speaking of cats,” he said, “I want to introduce
you to one who is a prince, or rather
a king, among them, and perhaps you won’t
have quite such a low opinion of the gentry.
Stoop your heads now; the shrubbery is pretty
dense here.”</p>

<p>The two nurses and the children gazed admiringly
before them. They were facing a
most snug retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>“And sure, a fox might be happy there, if it
wasn’t for the highway near by,” said Bridget
enthusiastically, “And what’s the baste that
lives in this little wild wood home, officer?”</p>

<p>The sergeant was holding back some branches
so that they might see more plainly a tiny
wooden kennel heaped high with dead leaves.</p>

<p>“It’s a king that lives here,” he said; and
he lifted toward his auditors his face that was
red from stooping over the kennel.</p>

<p>“You didn’t know, French boy,” and he addressed
Eugene, “that there was a sovereign
over all this park land that rules as absolutely
as your emperor did.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible that you speak of a cat?”
said the boy contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Of nothing more nor less, of King Boozy,
monarch of this park, because he has got character
enough to rule over the other twenty
cats that live here.”</p>

<p>Little Virgie was charmed. Before Eugene
could reply, she dropped on her hands and
knees, and crawled in beside the sergeant.
“Oh, the little sweet housie!” she cried, patting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the tiny dwelling with both hands.
“Who made it, mister? does the pussy sleep
in it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, little one,” said the sergeant. “A
gentleman connected with one of the Boston
theatres had this kennel made for the king
of the park, who always sleeps in it. His
chum occupies that barrel over there.”</p>

<p>“And is it another cat that is his chum?”
asked Bridget.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the sergeant. “There is
only one cat in the park that the king will
have to live with him; and that is his chum,
Squirrel, and he has to mind his <i>p’s</i> and <i>q’s</i>, I
tell you, or Boozy would put him out. What
do you think of this for a cat’s home, young
sir?” and he addressed Eugene.</p>

<p>The boy backed out from the underbrush,
slightly curling his lip as he did so. “I do
not admire the name of the animal,” he said
coldly; “and why take all that trouble for a
cat?”</p>

<p>The sergeant mopped his perspiring face
with his handkerchief. “I will talk to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
a little about the king,” he said, “and then
perhaps you will see.”</p>

<p>The path upon which they had entered
ran along by the low stone parapet of the
Boylston-street bridge. The sergeant took
his station against the parapet, while his listeners
stood grouped about him in the mild
sunshine.</p>

<p>“I believe,” said the sergeant, pointing up
to the bright blue sky above them, “in an
almighty Ruler of the universe that creates
all things,—men and women and horses and
dogs and cats.”</p>

<p>“And so do I,” murmured Bridget, crossing
herself. “Praise be to his holy name.”</p>

<p>“And I believe,” continued the sergeant,
“that this almighty Ruler does not despise
anything that he has made—not even a cat.”</p>

<p>Eugene smiled a little ironically, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>“Four years ago,” went on the sergeant,
“I was on duty in this park early one fine
summer morning. Down there near Commonwealth
Avenue I saw a black-and-white cat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
coming leisurely toward me. Every few steps
he took he would look over his shoulder in
the direction of the houses, then he would
walk toward the park again. I have always
been fond of cats; so I said ‘Good-morning’
to him as polite as you please. ‘Meow,’
he said; and he looked pitifully up at me.
‘What’s the matter?’ I asked. ‘Are you going
to the park to catch a mouse for yourself
this fine morning?’ ‘Meow, meow,’ he
said; and he meant, ‘No, no,’ just as plain
as a creature could say it. Then he turned,
and walked back in the direction he had
come, looking over his shoulder, and begging
me to follow as plain as possible. I thought
I would go, for I knew something was wrong;
and do you know that cat took me as straight
as a child would have done down to a fine
shut-up house. I suspected what was the
matter; however, I rang the bell of the next
house, and inquired.”</p>

<p>“They had gone away and left the cat,
hadn’t they?” interjected Eugene’s nurse.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the sergeant grimly. “That’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the figure of it. Mrs. Grandlady, whose name
you might know if I mentioned it, had taken
herself and her dear children and her dear
horses to the country; but the dear cat was
left to shift for himself. I was sorry for the
creature. He went up on the front steps.
He went up on the back ones. He listened,
he pricked up his ears. He stared at me as
if to say, ‘Do you really think they have left
me?’ And when I left him he cried. For
three weeks that cat hung about the house
listening for some one to come back. I got
the lady’s address, and wrote to her, but she
didn’t answer; then I reasoned with the cat,
and said, ‘You had better come up to the
park.’ Finally he came. I never saw such
a human-like creature. He’d never been ill-used,
and he could not seem to understand
that any one would hurt him. He has got
over that now all right. Dogs chase him,
and boys stone him, and he’s a different cat.
He is shy of strangers, and I don’t think
he would go back to his old mistress if she
came for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Isn’t he a good pussy now?” asked Virgie.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” said the sergeant, smiling; “he
is good, but he is a little sharper than he
used to be. He has got to know the world;
and he believes that might is right, and he
lords it over the other cats in the park. He
thinks every one is down on him but me.
He has lost faith in human nature—you will
understand that when you get to be a big
girl.”</p>

<p>“I would like to see that pussy,” said Virgie
wistfully.</p>

<p>“I’ll call him up,” said the sergeant, “if
your nurses will stand back. He hates women.”</p>

<p>“Och, the old rascal!” said Bridget wrathfully.</p>

<p>“You see, it’s this way,” and the sergeant
spoke in an apologetic tone of voice. “Probably
he was the kitchen cat and the cook’s
pet, because he isn’t a fancy breed like those
parlor cats. When the cook cast him off he
lost his liking for women.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t want to see the old turncoat,”
said Bridget disdainfully. “Come on, Virtue
Ann;” and she twitched herself to a little distance,
leaving the two children with the sergeant.</p>

<p>“You want to see the king, don’t you?”
the sergeant asked Eugene pointedly.</p>

<p>The boy had been listening in a half-hearted
way; but at this question he roused himself
and said, “Certainly, sir.”</p>

<p>The sergeant gave a long, low whistle; and
presently there was a rustling heard behind
them, and a prosperous-looking white cat spotted
with black came, yawning and stretching himself,
through the underbrush.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Boozy,” said the sergeant,
as the animal, with the appearance of the greatest
delight, sprang on the parapet of the bridge,
and purringly stretched himself out toward his
friend.</p>

<p>“He is very jealous, is Boozy,” said the sergeant
kindly, rubbing the cat’s head. “Don’t
come any nearer, little miss. He don’t like
to see strangers with me, and he is shy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
everything now. He wouldn’t come near me
for a while after the park uniform was changed
from gray to blue.”</p>

<p>“He caresses you because you feed him,”
said Eugene, with a side glance at the animal,
who had stretched himself on his back, and
was playfully biting and patting the sergeant’s
hand.</p>

<p>“You don’t enter into the animal’s feelings
at all,” said the sergeant benevolently. “You
don’t think that there is a little heart inside
that furry body—that it grew sick and sad
when it was shut out from its home.”</p>

<p>“I do not comprehend in the least,” said
Eugene in his most grown-up fashion. “A cat
cannot suffer.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps some day you will understand,”
said the sergeant kindly. “In the meantime
let me tell you something that will prove to
you that the cat does like me. Some months
ago I was transferred to the Public Garden;
and this cat, that would not come out of these
bushes for a stranger, not if he was to whistle
till doomsday, braved the racket of the streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and, what was worse to him, the people, and
went down there to find me.”</p>

<p>“The sweet little pussy!” squealed Virgie.
“Mister Policeman, let me stroke him.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but come gently,” said the sergeant.</p>

<p>Virgie, however, made a delighted run, that
sent the cat flying into the underbrush.</p>

<p>The sergeant looked amused and went on.
“I didn’t know what to make of it when I
looked down, and saw the king purring with
joy, and rubbing himself against my legs. I
said, ‘Boozy, go back to the Fens; this is no
place for a cat, and maybe I’ll be sent there
by and by.’”</p>

<p>“Did he return?” asked Eugene.</p>

<p>“Yes; he came straight back here; and I
begged for an exchange, and here I found him
on the lookout for me when I was sent back.
Don’t fret, little miss; you can see the king another
day. I will try to call up his chum for
you,” and he whistled again. Boozy’s chum,
however, did not come.</p>

<p>“He is probably hunting,” said the sergeant.
“He and Boozy between them keep this end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of the park clean, and do good service to the
city of Boston. They know all the holes of
the mice and moles that would destroy the
plants, and many a morning bright and early
have I seen those two cats watching beside
them. They catch sparrows too; smart isn’t
the word for them; and the other day Boozy
tackled an eel.”</p>

<p>“An eel,” said Eugene, who was beginning
to get interested; “one of those creatures parallel
to a snake that lives in the water?”</p>

<p>“The same,” said the sergeant, chuckling.
“The king got mad with the eel because he
wouldn’t submit quietly to being killed, but
wound himself tightly round his body. Boozy
was surprised that the eel would dare to meddle
with him, the king of the park; and he bit the
life out of him in two minutes.”</p>

<p>“I have read,” said Eugene, “that cats dislike
water.”</p>

<p>“They mostly do,” said the sergeant. “We
have an old thing, though, down below that
comes in every morning as wet as a seal from
fishing. But she doesn’t dare to come up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
here. Boozy would box her ears, and send
her home. This part of the park belongs to
him and his chum. He makes the other twenty
cats keep to their own end of it.”</p>

<p>“He is a naughty pussy to box the ears of
the other pussies,” said Virgie warmly.</p>

<p>“You must remember, little miss, that human
beings have been a bit rough on Boozy,” said
the sergeant with a mischievous twinkle in his
eye, “and he has learned some bad habits from
them.”</p>

<p>“Does the cat live here in winter?” asked
Eugene.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! he doesn’t mind the change of
seasons. We shovel about twenty feet of path
for him, and clear the snow from the parapet
so he can lie in the sun. Then I’m a little
particular about his food—you haven’t seen
his dining-room;” and he pointed to a sheltered
nook where sheets of brown paper overspread
the ground. “Come around any day
at 1.30, and you’ll see King Boozy at dinner.”</p>

<p>“We’ll come running and jumping to see
the sweet pussy,” said Virgie. “I’ll go ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Bridget not to forget me about it;” and she
ran away in the direction of the nurses.</p>

<p>“Where are these other cats that you speak
of?” asked Eugene with affected indifference.</p>

<p>“Oh! you’re beginning to get interested, are
you,” said the sergeant. “I’ll show them to
you some other day. I must go now, and find
out what those fellows are doing in that boat
on the pond. Good-by, Boozy;” and waving
his hand to the cat, that he knew was staring
at him from some secluded nook, he was about
to hurry away from the lad, when he remembered
something, and turned on his heel. “Before
I go,” he said, “let me tell you, young
boy, that I know what your grandfather does.”</p>

<p>“Did you presume to force inquiries,” said
the lad quickly, “when I assured you that I
should tell you myself?”</p>

<p>“No; I did not. I happened to remember
that I had seen some one answering to the
description of what I’d suppose your grandfather
to be like in a French jeweller’s shop
on Washington Street. He mends watches,
doesn’t he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” scarcely breathed the boy, with an
agonized blush.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t feel bad about it, if I were you,”
said the sergeant compassionately. “That’s a
decent way of getting a living.”</p>

<p>“For you, yes,” said the boy mournfully;
“for a de Vargas, no;” and dropping his young
head on his breast, he walked away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="small">A CHILD IN TROUBLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The sergeant had not seen Eugene for a
week; but although he had not seen him, he
could not get him out of his mind.</p>

<p>As he sauntered about the park day after
day, his vigilant eyes going hither and thither
over roads and foot-paths to see that no trespassers
loitered in them and defaced the growing
trees, or launched boats without permission
on the waterways, Eugene’s pale, thoughtful,
and rather unhappy face floated constantly before
him.</p>

<p>“It’s queer, the interest I take in him,” he
said to himself on the last day of the week.
“It must be because he spoke up so frank-like,
and asked me to be his friend. He’s of a
different cut from any other lad I ever saw.
Guess I’ll look him up after I get off to-day.
I’d like to inquire about him, anyway; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
there’s no one to ask here, for the little miss
and her nurse have given up coming too. I
guess they’ve been promenading on the sunny
side of Commonwealth Avenue on account of
the wind in the Fens.”</p>

<p>Every evening at six the sergeant went off
duty. On that evening, instead of going home,
he bent his footsteps toward No. 29 Lovejoy
Street.</p>

<p>While turning a corner swiftly he ran into
a girl who was hurrying along with her head
bent forward.</p>

<p>It was Virtue Ann, Eugene’s nurse; and on
seeing the sergeant, she threw up her head
with a quick catching of her breath.</p>

<p>“Did I frighten you?” asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir!” said Virtue Ann miserably.</p>

<p>“Then, what’s the matter with you?” he
asked in a puzzled voice.</p>

<p>“It’s not you,” said Virtue Ann, bringing
her handkerchief out of her pocket, and rolling
it into a little ball.</p>

<p>“What is it then?”</p>

<p>“It’s the little boy—his grandfather’s dead,
you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not the little French boy’s grandfather?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for this,” said the sergeant soberly.
“That’s why you haven’t come to the
Fens.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And what’s the boy going to do?”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh! that’s what bothers me;” and Virtue
Ann’s tears began to shower down like rain.
“It’s an awful hard case. There he sits day
after day in those little stuffy rooms, waiting
for a letter from France; and if what he wants
doesn’t come something just too dreadful for
anything will happen.”</p>

<p>“Too dreadful!” repeated the sergeant.
“Come now, young woman, take it easy, and
just stop crying, will you? There’s lots of
charitable people in this city, and orphans’
homes and so on. He’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he’d go into an orphans’
home?” said Virtue Ann, drying her eyes
and speaking half indignantly. “You don’t
know him, sir. He’s proud and shy, like a little
old man. His grandfather made him just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
like himself. Oh! he’s got a lot to answer for.
He was a queer old man, and went peering
about with those little eyes of his, just as if
he was looking out for wickedness in everything.”</p>

<p>“Has the boy relatives in France?” asked
the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Yes; one rich grand-uncle on his mother’s
side. It was to him Master Eugene wrote;
and how do you think he began his letter, sir?
He had no one else by him; so he read it to me,
and put it into English so I could understand.
It began this way, ‘Robber, my grandfather
is now dead; and I call upon you to restore
to me, his rightful heir, the chatto’—is that
the right word, sir?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” said the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway,” continued Virtue Ann,
“Master Eugene laid down the law to him.
He wants him to give up this big house, and
the servants and some money, and if he does
not that little innocent creature will—oh, dear,
dear!” and she fell to catching her breath
again, and could not speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>“What will he do?” asked the sergeant
impatiently.</p>

<p>“It’s too miserable—I can’t say it,” replied
Virtue Ann. “He’ll make way with himself,
the little dear.”</p>

<p>“Are you crazy?” asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>“No, sir—no, sir. You don’t know that boy.
If you’d lived with him as I have you’d understand
him. He’s just as set in his way as a
man. Why, he’s even told me how he’ll kill
himself;” and she whispered a few words in
the sergeant’s ear that made him start back
and stare at her.</p>

<p>“Do go see him,” said Virtue Ann. “He
took a kind of a fancy to you; I guess it must
have been your uniform.”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” said the sergeant. “Where
are you going?”</p>

<p>“To the corner grocery for some bread and
olives.”</p>

<p>“Well, you go on then, and I’ll call to see
the child.”</p>

<p>“I’ll hurry back,” said Virtue Ann; and
she sped on her way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>The sergeant went quickly down the street
until he found No. 29. On arriving there, he
stepped inside the lobby; and after ringing the
bell marked 4, he put his ear to the tube beside
it.</p>

<p>Presently he heard in Eugene’s clear voice,
“Who is there?”</p>

<p>“Sergeant Hardy,” replied the man.</p>

<p>“Will you have the goodness to walk up?”
said Eugene; and as he spoke he pressed a
spring that made the entrance door fly open,
and enabled the sergeant to enter, and mount
the long flight of stairs.</p>

<p>At the top of the house he found himself in
a narrow, uncarpeted hall, where a door stood
wide open with Eugene beside it.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” said the boy gravely,
extending his hand.</p>

<p>“I’m well,” said the sergeant; “and I’m
sorry to hear of your trouble.”</p>

<p>Eugene bowed in his unchildish fashion,
and led the way to a small, barely furnished
parlor.</p>

<p>The sergeant put his helmet on the table,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and sat down by a window, from which an
extended view of distant hills could be had
over the tops of far and near houses; while
Eugene seated himself opposite, and stretching
out his slender arms and legs, tried hard to fill
the chair that had been a favorite one with his
dead grandfather.</p>

<p>His endeavor to look grave and manly was
not successful. He only impressed the sergeant
as being curiously pitiful and pathetic; and the
words, “Poor little chap,” burst almost involuntarily
from his lips.</p>

<p>Eugene grew rather white; but he managed
to bow again, and to say composedly, “Thank
you, Mr. Officer.”</p>

<p>“When did your grandfather die?” asked
the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Five days ago.”</p>

<p>“And was it sudden?”</p>

<p>“Extremely so. He came home from the
town much fatigued. He lay down on his
bed, rose up once, and called in a loud voice,
‘Eugene!’ I ran to him, but the breath had
left him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have written to your relatives?” said
the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Eugene. “I sent a letter to
my grand-uncle, who bought from the government
the confiscated estate of my grandfather.
I demanded money from him to enable me to
live. If he sends it, all will be well. If
not”—</p>

<p>“Well, if not,” said the sergeant, “there
are plenty of people here who will look after
you.”</p>

<p>Eugene’s pale face flushed. “Could I become
a pauper? No, Mr. Officer. If I do not
receive some of the rents from my grandfather’s
estate, I shall dispose of myself otherwise.”</p>

<p>“How long since you’ve been out doors?”
asked the sergeant abruptly.</p>

<p>“Not since my grandfather died,” said
Eugene sadly. “I have not cared for it.”</p>

<p>“Will you go home with me now and have
supper?” asked the sergeant. “I would be
proud and happy to show you my wife.”</p>

<p>Before Eugene could speak, a clapping of
hands was heard. Virtue Ann had come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
quietly in, and had heard the sergeant’s proposal.
“Yes, Master Eugene, do go,” she said
joyfully.</p>

<p>Eugene hesitated. “Do, please,” said Virtue
Ann coaxingly; “it will do you good.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir, I accept with alacrity your
invitation,” said Eugene, slipping from his
chair, and standing before the sergeant. “It
is necessary that I put on my velvet suit,” he
went on, with a slight sparkle in his eyes, and
addressing Virtue Ann as he passed her.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” she replied; “I will come and
get it down for you.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes she came hurrying back
to the sergeant. “I’m right glad you asked
him, sir. I never was in such a tight box in
my life as to know what to do about this child.
You see, I’m a stranger here, as you might say,
for I’ve only been four months in the city;
and his grandfather didn’t seem to have any
friends, and I don’t know any one to go to, and
his money is most gone, and he’s such a queer
little thing, and flies into a rage if I cross him;
and I don’t know what to do, and I wish you’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
advise him. I asked Bridget to talk to Mrs.
Manning about him,—that’s the little girl’s
mother; but she says the lady would clap him
into a school or some place with a lot of children,
where he’d be most crazy. I’ll go see
Bridget again to-night. I wish I’d money to
keep the little dear with me, if he’d stay. He’s
so sweet and elegant in his ways; but I’m only
a poor girl, and I’m getting pretty near my
last dollar—oh, here he is! Good-by, Master
Eugene; I’ll call for you at nine.”</p>

<p>The sergeant and Eugene went slowly down
the staircase, and Virtue Ann stood watching
them until they were out of sight. Then she
drew a long sigh, and went into the kitchen to
get something to eat.</p>

<p>The sergeant and Eugene scarcely spoke as
they went along the street. The man was
silent because he was wondering what he could
do to help the boy beside him. The boy was
silent because, despite himself, a soft joy and
peace were stealing into his troubled heart, as
he once more mingled with his fellow-beings,
and breathed the pure evening air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the sergeant stopped before a neat
wooden house near the Fens. “This is my
home,” he said.</p>

<p>Eugene brought back his eyes from the distant
horizon, and flashed a quick, appreciative
glance at the small house and the pretty garden.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the sergeant gruffly. “My
wife will be getting the supper.”</p>

<p>Eugene saw no face looking out for them
between the ruffled window curtains. All was
quiet and still,—the sergeant had evidently no
children; and the boy thoughtfully went into
the house, and hung up his cap on a rack in
the hall.</p>

<p>“I’ll not put you in the parlor,” said the
sergeant. “Let’s go find the missis;” and he
stalked out toward the kitchen at the back of
the house.</p>

<p>Eugene followed him curiously, and with
some hesitation.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_052a.jpg" alt="Visitor" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="smcap small">“Well, Wife, I’ve brought a Visitor Home To-night.”</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>“Isn’t that a picture?” said the sergeant.
He had pushed open the kitchen door; and
Eugene, looking in, saw a small, exquisitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
clean room, with pictures on the walls, and
white curtains at the windows, and a woman
cooking something over a gas-stove.</p>

<p>“Well, wife,” said the sergeant agreeably,
“I’ve brought a visitor home to-night; he’s
the little French boy I told you about. He
has had a great misfortune,—his grandfather
is dead;” and he gently pushed Eugene forward.</p>

<p>The woman raised her head slightly; and
Eugene saw that she had a fresh face, rather
younger than the sergeant’s, clear blue eyes,
and a quantity of soft white hair.</p>

<p>“Stephen,” she said, in a spoiled, almost
childish voice, “how could you? there’s only
stew enough for two, and you know I don’t
like boys.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know,” he said good-naturedly.
“Here’s the boy; just look round and tell him
so yourself.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy did turn around in the twinkling
of an eye, the uplifted spoon in her hand.
“How do you do?” she said quickly. “I didn’t
see you—don’t mind what I say. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
just a little prejudice against boys, because they
tease my cats.”</p>

<p>“And this boy has a little prejudice against
you on two scores,” said the sergeant, chuckling
amiably.</p>

<p>“What are they?” asked Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you later on,” said the sergeant.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy laughed softly, and bent her
white head over the stove; while her husband
pointed to a rocking-chair drawn up by one
of the windows, and hospitably invited Eugene
to sit down on it.</p>

<p>Eugene, however, would not seat himself
while his hostess was standing, and contented
himself with leaning against it.</p>

<p>The sergeant excused himself, and went
away to change his uniform; while Mrs. Hardy,
between the intervals of stirring the dish on
the stove, looked curiously at Eugene over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>She was dressed all in white; and there was
something so attractive and unique in her appearance,
in her fresh face and her snowy
hair, that the boy had difficulty in keeping
himself from staring at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>“So your grandfather is dead,” she said in
a low voice, as if she were talking to herself.
“You must feel badly about it, though you
are only a boy.”</p>

<p>Eugene, without knowing why, felt himself
growing sorry for her because she was sorry
for him.</p>

<p>“One must suffer in this world,” he said
patronizingly. “It is fate.”</p>

<p>“You are young to have found that out,”
said the woman quietly. Then, before he
could answer her, she said, “Do you like
oyster stew?”</p>

<p>“I shall eat with pleasure anything that
you prepare, madam,” said the boy courteously;
“and, indeed, that is one of my favorite
dishes—allow me to assist you;” and he
hurried forward to help her in carrying the
dish to the near dining-room.</p>

<p>“Did you hear me say that there would
not be enough oysters for three?” asked Mrs.
Hardy, fixing her bright blue eyes on the
boy’s face.</p>

<p>“No, madam,” he said without hesitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you must have—you were close by.”</p>

<p>Eugene tried not to smile, but he could
not help it.</p>

<p>“You are telling a story in order to save
my feelings, aren’t you?” she said brusquely.</p>

<p>Eugene shrugged his shoulders. “A story—well,
scarcely that.”</p>

<p>“It is better to hurt my feelings,” she said
gravely, “than to say what is not true. I
spoke too quickly about the oysters. Here
is cold meat and a salad—we shall have
enough. I suppose you like oil in your
salad.”</p>

<p>“I do, madam.”</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed French people do. My husband
takes sugar and vinegar on his. Now
I will get the chocolate, and we can sit down
as soon as Stephen comes.”</p>

<p>“Why, you and my wife are getting on famously,”
said the sergeant, rubbing his hands
as he entered the room.</p>

<p>Eugene looked at him. His appearance
was quite changed. He was now dressed in
a suit of dark brown clothes, and he wore a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
red necktie, and had a white flower in his
buttonhole.</p>

<p>“This boy is not like other boys,” said
Mrs. Hardy calmly; “he is a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“So you like him,” said the sergeant teasingly.
“A pity it is that he can’t like you.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t he like me?” said Mrs. Hardy,
sitting down behind the chocolate and milk
pitchers, and motioning Eugene to sit beside
her.</p>

<p>“Because you are two things that he
doesn’t care for.”</p>

<p>“What are they?”</p>

<p>“You are a woman and a former school-teacher.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you like women?” asked Mrs.
Hardy of Eugene.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said gallantly, “the world
would be a dreary place without your charming
sex.”</p>

<p>“And school-teachers?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I detest them,” he said frankly,
“with but few exceptions;” and he bowed
to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you always talk like this?” asked
Mrs. Hardy with undisguised curiosity.</p>

<p>Eugene smiled at her. He knew that he
talked like a grown-up man.</p>

<p>“Don’t tease the boy,” said the sergeant.
“He isn’t a prig, anyway. Do you know,”
he went on, addressing Eugene, “that I’m
very fond of my wife?”</p>

<p>“You do not surprise me,” said Eugene
with his lips; and in his heart he thought,
“What astonishing candor! I never met such
people.”</p>

<p>“Her father used to be worth his weight
in gold,” said the sergeant. “He owned a
flour-mill. Then he failed and died; and my
wife, like a brave girl, taught and supported
herself till I married her. I guess she’ll
never do that again, though. She has got a
rich old aunt that is going to leave her some
money some day, so she will be provided for
whatever happens to me.”</p>

<p>“I congratulate you,” said Eugene to his
hostess.</p>

<p>“I hope your grand-uncle will do as square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
a thing by you as her aunt is doing by her,”
said the sergeant. “We’ve got it down in
black and white.”</p>

<p>Eugene’s face grew so pale that Mrs. Hardy
shook her head at her husband. Then she
pressed the boy to eat various things that
she laid on his plate.</p>

<p>“Your hair is just like a pile of snow
to-night,” said the sergeant, affectionately regarding
the top of his wife’s head. “Do
you know, boy, some people are mischievous
enough to ask if that hair has been turned
white on account of my sins?” and he
laughed uproariously. “What do you tell
them, Bess?”</p>

<p>“I tell them no,” she said, shaking her
head. “We all turn gray in our family when
we’re forty.”</p>

<p>“It gives you the appearance of being in
<i>grande toilette</i>,” said Eugene, who had recovered
his composure. “One could imagine you just
stepping into your carriage to attend a ball.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy looked pleased, and handed him
a huge slice of cake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hardys did not spend a very long time
at the table; and when supper was over the
sergeant withdrew to the garden to smoke,
while Eugene begged to assist his hostess in
carrying the dishes to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Do you really want to do it?” she said
earnestly; “or is it only your politeness that
makes you ask? No, don’t answer quickly;
take a minute to think.”</p>

<p>Out through the open window Eugene could
see the little garden flooded with electric light
from the near street, and the sergeant sauntering
about it with a pipe in his mouth.</p>

<p>“You had rather be with him, had you not?”
said Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>“I had,” replied Eugene, the words slipping
out of his mouth before he could recall them.</p>

<p>“Then, run away,” said Mrs. Hardy; “it is
good for boys to be in the open air as much
as possible, and I am used to washing my
dishes myself. That china belonged to my
mother, and was very expensive, and you might
let it fall; and then, perhaps you would spot
your velvet suit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Eugene went out-of-doors; and while walking
about the moist garden paths, he followed
the sergeant’s directions with regard to picking
a number of the sweet tremulous flowers to
take home with him.</p>

<p>“What games can you play?” asked the
sergeant as his eye ran over the pleasing symmetry
of Eugene’s figure.</p>

<p>“I can fence and dance,” said Eugene, “and
ride passably; also I am fond of fishing, and I
can run well at the game one calls ‘prisoner’s
base’ in this country.”</p>

<p>“Good; but what have you done here? Do
you play base-ball and cricket or foot-ball?”</p>

<p>“Not as yet,” said the boy sadly, but proudly;
“we can afford nothing.”</p>

<p>“We must see to that if you stay in Boston,”
said the sergeant. “You’ll not make yourself
a man if you don’t have manly exercise. Why,
here’s Dodo coming home, and old Toddles
with her.”</p>

<p>Eugene lifted up his eyes and smiled in
amusement at two rather decrepit cats that
were climbing the garden fence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>“These are our house cats,” said the sergeant,
“promoted from the park to home service
on account of old age. Come in, pussies,
and have some supper.”</p>

<p>The tortoiseshell pair before entering the
house walked purringly around the sergeant,
and rubbed themselves against his legs.</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful what affection the creatures
have,” he said musingly, as he took his pipe
from his mouth, and looked down at them.
“Don’t you like dumb animals, boy?”</p>

<p>“I had a pony in France that I rather cared
for,” said Eugene, “and I like hunting-dogs
imperfectly well.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t understand dumb creatures,”
said the sergeant. “I can tell by the way that
you speak that you don’t. There’s a whole
book of knowledge shut up from you, boy.
Some day perhaps it will be opened, and you’ll
enjoy life more from knowing that there are
more live things to enjoy it and to like you
than you have had any suspicion of. Let’s
go in now. I guess the missis has got things
tidied.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy was standing on the porch, looking
like a girl with her slim figure and white
gown.</p>

<p>“Would you like to play some games?” she
asked her guest softly.</p>

<p>He showed a polite pleasure at the proposal,
and during the next two hours Mrs. Hardy
initiated him into the mysteries of some American
parlor amusements that he had never before
heard of.</p>

<p>When Virtue Ann came for him, his cheeks
were flushed and his face happy. He looked
like a different boy from the little careworn
creature that had arrived there a few hours
earlier.</p>

<p>“Thank you kindly, ma’am,” said Virtue
Ann in a low voice to Mrs. Hardy; “you’ve
done an angel’s deed in comforting him. I’m
sure I don’t know what’s to become of the
little lad;” and she sighed heavily.</p>

<p>All the evening Mrs. Hardy had been regarding
the boy with a curious intentness of
gaze. At Virtue Ann’s words her eyes again
wandered to Eugene; and she said wistfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
“Do you say that he is quite alone in the
world, quite, quite alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes; except his old grand-uncle in France,”
said Virtue Ann with a sniff. “He’ll not do
anything for him, I misdoubt. I’ve heard the
grandfather talking about him; and I guess
he’s no better than a skinflint, and”—but here
Virtue Ann was obliged to break off abruptly,
for Eugene came forward to take leave of his
hostess.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy listened with a smile on her
face to his well-bred assurances that he had
had a pleasant visit.</p>

<p>“You were criticising us all the time,” she
said keenly; and when Eugene, in discomposure,
could do nothing but gaze helplessly at
her, she bent down suddenly and kissed him.</p>

<p>“Never mind, little lad,” she said, “I know
that this has been a change for you. Good-night,
good-night;” and long after her husband
went into the house, she stood in the doorway,
her eyes wandering down the street that Virtue
Ann and her young charge had taken to go
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Virtue Ann had been quite impressed by the
cosiness and pretty furnishings of the little
cottage, and by the mingled dignity and oddity
of the sergeant’s wife.</p>

<p>“She was like an old picture with that white
hair,” she murmured to herself; “and yet there’s
no nonsense about her. I guess she’s a good
housekeeper too, for everything was as neat as
wax. What a good home that would be for
Master Eugene!” and she sighed as she glanced
at the quiet lad beside her.</p>

<p>Sergeant Hardy was tired that night, and
went to bed as soon as Eugene had left his
house. About one o’clock he was awakened
by the sound of suppressed sobbing; and starting
up in bed, he dimly saw his wife standing
by the window.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Bess?” he asked
sleepily.</p>

<p>She lifted her white head that she had laid
against the window-pane. “O Stephen! did I
wake you? I’m sorry. It’s nothing—go to
sleep again.”</p>

<p>“People don’t get up out of bed in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of the night to go lean up against windows
and stare out into the dark for nothing,”
he said in a matter-of-fact way. “What’s
wrong with you, Bess?”</p>

<p>“Stephen,” she said in a repressed voice,
“in all the years that we’ve been married
you’ve often heard me say how glad I am
that I’ve never had a child.”</p>

<p>“Often, Bess.”</p>

<p>“How glad—how delighted I am,” she
went on quietly, though he knew by her tones
that she was trembling like a leaf, “that we
have not had to launch another little child
into this world of care and trouble; it’s such
a sad world for children.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” he said, trying not to
yawn as he listened to her.</p>

<p>“They’re such a worry when they’re growing
up,” she continued sorrowfully; “they get
ill, and you have to fuss over them in the
daytime, and they call you out of your warm
bed at night.”</p>

<p>“Of course they do,” he responded. “They’re
always bleating like lambs after their parents.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>“And mothers get dragged down and worn
out; and then, when the little things grow old
enough to be a comfort, they go away from
you out into the world, or else you die and
leave them, and almost break your heart in the
going, because you think other people won’t
be as tender with them as you have been.”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” growled the sergeant. “A
body would almost think you had been
through the experience.”</p>

<p>“There are too many children in the
world,” said his wife vehemently. “Hear me
say again, Stephen, that I’m glad, glad, <i>glad</i>,
that I have never had any;” and she sank out
of his sight into a seat in a dark corner, and
covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>“You’re so glad,” said her husband kindly,
and yet a little ironically, “that you’re crying
your eyes out about it.”</p>

<p>“Let me alone, Stephen,” she said passionately;
“let me cry. You have always been
kind and indulgent with me, and let me have
my own way; and I have got selfish, and look
out always for my own comfort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! never mind, never mind, Bess,” he
said consolingly. “Get into bed again; you’ll
take cold.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” she exclaimed. “Let me be
unselfish for once. Let me imagine that in
the next room there is a little sick child, that
it may call me at any minute, that I must be
ready to go to it;” and sobbing as if her
heart would break, she drew her white hair
over her head like a veil, and curled herself
up miserably on the low seat.</p>

<p>The sergeant looked in her direction compassionately
and with resignation. “I’d cry
with you, Bess, if I could,” he said drowsily,
“but I can’t. I’ll get up and make a hot
drink for you, though, if you like.”</p>

<p>“No, no; I don’t want a hot drink,” she
moaned.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll just let you alone. You
women like to make yourselves miserable
sometimes,” he said philosophically; and laying
his head down on the pillow, he was soon
asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="small">THE REST OF THE CATS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Eugene had faithfully promised the sergeant
that he would go for a walk in the park the
next morning, and there the sergeant accordingly
met him at eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>The boy was strolling along the southern
part of the Fens; and as he halted near the
Agassiz bridge, the sergeant caught up with
him.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” he said cheerily. “Where’s
your nurse with the good name to-day?”</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” said Eugene with a bright
look at him. “Virtue Ann had sweeping to
do; and she says that I am now sufficiently
old to go out unattended, though it is not
the custom to do so in my country until one
is older.”</p>

<p>“You’re big enough to go alone,” said the
sergeant. “We think here that it makes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
mollycoddle of a boy to have some one at his
heels watching him all the time. Have you
paid your respects to John O’Reilly this morning?”</p>

<p>“No; I have just arrived from home. I
shall go there later.”</p>

<p>“No news from France yet I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! it is not time.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have to wait. There’s nothing
like patience in this life. Don’t you want to
come down this path with me, and see the rest
of my colony of cats? This is where they
live.”</p>

<p>“It will give me great pleasure,” said
Eugene.</p>

<p>The sergeant turned abruptly from the road
to a shady path leading to a duck-pond. Stationing
himself midway in it, he gave a whistle
that Eugene noticed was quite different from
his call for King Boozy.</p>

<p>The boy stood aside; and presently he saw
little gray heads peeping cautiously from between
the leaves, and heard a number of timid
voices giving tentative mews of welcome.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_070a.jpg" alt="Cats" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="smcap small">Then the Cats came fast enough, Young and Old, Gay and
                              Sober.</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>“It isn’t feeding-time,” said the sergeant;
“when it is they just tumble over each other
to get to me,—and they’re a little afraid of
you.”</p>

<p>Eugene drew still farther back; and then
the cats came fast enough,—young and old,
gay and sober ones, purring contentedly and
waving their tails, as they circled in and out
about the sergeant, and jumped up to rub themselves
against him.</p>

<p>“Those are sisters,” said the sergeant, indicating
two young gray pussies who were
walking about with tails held proudly aloft;
“and that is the old mother, the queen of
the gang,” he added, laughing at an austere
Maltese cat who was cuffing the ears of a kitten;
“she makes them stand round.”</p>

<p>Eugene addressed a complimentary remark
to the Maltese cat, who stared at him suspiciously
from eyes that looked like white currants
in the strong light of the sun.</p>

<p>“You can’t deceive her,” said the sergeant,
as the cat turned away from Eugene to join
the band about their patron. “She knows you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
don’t like her. You can fool a human being
quicker than you can an animal; and an
animal won’t lie as often as a human being,
though they will do it sometimes. You needn’t
try to catch them, little one,” he went on, addressing
a child who came suddenly racing
down a path; “they won’t let any one but
the park police lay a hand on them.”</p>

<p>Every cat had disappeared at the advent of
the child, and with a disappointed face she
went back the way she had come.</p>

<p>“Would you like to see the cats’ winter bedfellows?”
said the sergeant, addressing Eugene.</p>

<p>“I should like it remarkably well,” said the
boy; and he followed the sergeant to the duck-pond.</p>

<p>On arriving there the sergeant gave a third
variety of whistle, and a host of glossy creatures
rushed ashore, quacking and gabbling reproachfully
at their friend, who stood merely
looking at them without offering them food.</p>

<p>“They’re annoyed with me,” he said; and
he laughed, as the ducks one and all struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the ground sharply with their beaks, and turning
their backs on him filed into the pond.</p>

<p>“You greedy things,” he went on; “your
thoughts don’t get much higher than good
living, though you’re pretty kind to the cats
in winter. Do you know ducks and cats all
sleep together after it gets cold?”</p>

<p>“Really!” ejaculated Eugene. “Is that a
possible thing?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the sergeant; “they sleep in
boxes filled with hay. My wife says it is
‘sweet’ to see the ducklings and kittens
brought up together. She has a very kind
heart for animals, has my wife.”</p>

<p>“I can well imagine that Mrs. Hardy is
always kind,” said Eugene.</p>

<p>The sergeant glanced at him sharply. The
boy spoke in the tones of ordinary politeness,
not warmly by any means.</p>

<p>“Do you keep no pigeons?” Eugene went
on.</p>

<p>“Yes, a few,” said the sergeant.</p>

<p>“And where is the place that they live,—the
<i>pigeonnier</i>, as one says in France?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the top of the duck-house. They have
no house of their own.”</p>

<p>“In France nearly every country house has
a <i>pigeonnier</i>,” said Eugene.</p>

<p>“We’ll get one here in time,” said the sergeant.
“Now, if you want to inspect the rest
of my menagerie, let us go back to the bridge.”</p>

<p>“What have you there?” asked Eugene as
they paced slowly up the path.</p>

<p>“A flock of twenty-one geese. See, there
they are out on the marshes. Hello, they’re
having a quarrel with the wild geese.”</p>

<p>“Have you wild ones also?”</p>

<p>“A few only. Hear how they’re screaming.
What tempers! I’ll whistle, and perhaps I’ll
catch their attention.”</p>

<p>The sergeant whistled in vain. The wind
was blowing over the marshes, and the geese
were too much engaged in their dispute to
heed his voice that only reached them faintly.</p>

<p>“They remind me of the prairie fowl out
West,” said the sergeant. “They were mighty
fond of dancing round each other, but they
always wound up with a row. Now, I haven’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
anything more to show you this morning. I
believe I’ll walk up Boylston Street way with
you a bit. Come over some feeding-time to
see these creatures. They’re more interesting
then. Don’t bring your nurse, though, down
here. These cats just hate women.”</p>

<p>“For the same reason that the king does?”
asked Eugene.</p>

<p>“Yes; they’ve mostly been turned out-of-doors
by women, and they don’t forget it. I’m
sorry it’s so, for I am fond of women myself;
but animals, and cats especially, don’t forget
an injury; that is, the most of them don’t.
They’re very like us, some forgive and some
don’t; and they’re just as full of contradictions
as we are. Some of them will put up with
things from the few people they like best that
they won’t put up with from a stranger. For
instance, a dog will let his master cuff him
round, when he’d bite a stranger that would
lay a finger on him. That’s just the way we
are with our own families. My wife and I
will take things from each other that we
wouldn’t from other people. By the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
there are some fine boys coming along that I’d
like to introduce you to. Do you see them?
That is a grand fellow, that one with the foot-ball
under his arm.”</p>

<p>Eugene shrank back, and made a gesture of
dissent.</p>

<p>“You’ll like them,” said the sergeant earnestly;
and before Eugene could speak he had
addressed the boys, who halted before him.</p>

<p>“We are going to run races on the long
path,” said one of them.</p>

<p>“You ought to cut over the ground like a
North Dakota jack-rabbit,” said the sergeant
turning to Eugene.</p>

<p>The French lad tried to speak, but could not.
He had so long been cut off from the society
of other boys that getting among them again
was like taking a plunge into a cold bath.
However, one boy, to whom the sergeant nodded
in a significant way, took Eugene under his
protection; and with unconcealed delight the
sergeant stood watching the round dozen of
them kick up their heels, and scamper over the
level road toward their racing-ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Eugene, to the sergeant’s pride, kept up
with the best of them. “He is long and lean,
just like a greyhound,” muttered the man as
he went contentedly on his tour of inspection
through the park; “but he looks a little underfed.
I wish he could get some of Bess’s roast
beef occasionally.”</p>

<p>When the sergeant went home to his dinner
at one o’clock, he told his wife about meeting
Eugene.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you sent him to play,” she said.
“His nurse has been here, and we were talking
about him. It’s a shame to have the child
so like an old man.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it is,” said the sergeant absently.
“What have you got for dinner, Bess? I’m
fearfully hungry, and I smell something good.”</p>

<p>“Steak and onions and apple-pie,” said his
wife. “Stephen, I want that boy.”</p>

<p>“You want that boy!” said her husband in
a dazed manner. “What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Just exactly what I say,” she replied with
great composure. “I want him to come here.
His nurse has heard of a good situation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
it is too bad to keep her on there living with
him when they have so little money.”</p>

<p>Her husband sat down to the table, and
began to carve the steak. “Bess,” he said
remonstratingly, “you couldn’t get him here—that
little thoroughbred, proud fellow. He
looks down on us.”</p>

<p>“Why does he look down on us?” asked
Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess he thinks we don’t belong
to the aristocracy.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you as good a man as there is in
this city?” asked Mrs. Hardy earnestly.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if I am,” said the sergeant
with great complacency, “though I
might be better than I am. But, Bess, you
don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“I understand this much,” she said. “Here
is a lonely child in a big city, without a soul
but a poor ignorant nurse to look after him.
If you take him by force, and put him somewhere
where he doesn’t want to go, he’ll pine
to death. If we can coax him here, and make
him happy till something is arranged”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all very fine,” said the sergeant;
“I see what you’re after, Bess. You’ve taken
a great fancy to that boy. You’ll get him here,
and fall to petting him; then, when he’s sent
for to go to France, you’ll break your heart.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he will ever be sent for,”
said Mrs. Hardy calmly.</p>

<p>The sergeant laid aside his knife and fork,
and brought his hand down on the table. “Now
understand, Bess, once for all, I’m not going
to bring up other people’s children. If I had
a son of my own it would be different. How
do we know how this little shaver will turn
out? His head is crammed full of notions,
and he thinks no more of telling a lie than I
do of telling the truth.”</p>

<p>“Some one has to bring him up,” said Mrs.
Hardy; “and he only tells stories out of politeness.
He will get over it.”</p>

<p>“I told you before that he’s different from
us,” said the sergeant irritably. “Don’t tease,
Bess.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t, Stephen,” she said quietly;
“perhaps you are right, only”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Only what?” asked her husband.</p>

<p>“Only I’m lonely here all day without you,”
she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Will you give me a cup of tea?” asked
her husband. “You’re not crying, are you?”
he went on suspiciously.</p>

<p>“No, Stephen; I cried enough last night to
last me for a long time.”</p>

<p>“You don’t usually have a crying-spell oftener
than once in six weeks,” he remarked with
assumed cheerfulness. “I guess some one
will look out for that boy. I daresay there
are lots of rich people in this city that would
adopt him if they knew what a grand family
he comes of.”</p>

<p>“Rich people aren’t as kind as poor ones,
Stephen, you know that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” he said warmly. “I notice it
isn’t the best-dressed people that give nickels
to the beggars in the streets. It’s the shabby
woman that takes out her purse when she
passes some poor wretch. She’s been there,
or near enough to pity—not that I approve
of encouraging begging,” he added in an official
manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>“It must be terrible not to have enough to
eat,” said Mrs. Hardy with a shudder.</p>

<p>The sergeant shuddered too. “Bess,” he
said, “it’s easy enough to say that, but not
one person in a million can feel it. Most
people haven’t the slightest idea what starvation
is. I’ve told you about my getting lost
out West on the plains. All the man went
out of me two days after we ate our last bite
of food. I was nothing but a beast. I could
have eaten you if you had been there. The
pain and the sickness and the dreams of food
were awful, and for weeks after we were found
I could digest only the simplest things. Do
you suppose that boy ever goes hungry?”</p>

<p>“Meat is rather expensive in Boston,” said
Mrs. Hardy. “I think by what the girl says
they don’t get much of that.”</p>

<p>The sergeant finished his dinner in silence;
and in silence he buckled on his belt, and took
his helmet and went to the front door. Then
he came back again.</p>

<p>“Bess,” he said gruffly, “you said last night
what a good husband I’d been to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Stephen,” she replied; “and I say it
again, now and always, and I don’t care who
hears me.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve been a good wife to me,” he
returned; “and I don’t care who hears me say
it, either. Get that boy here if you like—maybe
it is a good move. We’re always having
to do things in the dark in this life, and
then some way or other light shines on us;
but Bess”—and he hesitated, and looked at
her from under drooping eyelids as shyly as
if he were a boy himself.</p>

<p>She went up quickly to him, and laid a hand
on his broad chest. “I know what you want
to say, Stephen, you are jealous; you are afraid
I’ll think more of that little boy than I do of
you.”</p>

<p>“That’s about the figure of it,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?” she said,
“not only to mention such a thing to me, but
to dare to think it to yourself. You a big,
strong man to be jealous of that little delicate
lad. You know just as well as I do why I like
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>The sergeant’s face cleared. “You like him
for the same reason that you like the cats,” he
said. “He’s been cast out, and he hasn’t any
one to take an interest in him. Well, pet him
all you like, and have him here if you can get
him, I don’t care;” and the sergeant serenely
kissed her, and then wended his way back to
the park.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="small">MRS. HARDY MAKES A CALL.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the middle of that same afternoon, Bridget
and Virtue Ann were sitting in the latter’s
kitchen, talking volubly.</p>

<p>“And sure that’s a boss place,” Bridget
was saying. “You’d do well to jump at the
chance, Virtue Ann. Four girls kept, and
you only to do part of the up-stairs work;
and it’s lucky you are.”</p>

<p>“But the child,” said Virtue Ann uneasily.</p>

<p>“Troth, and it’s a pity about him,” said
Bridget; “but to look out for number one is
the game to-day. You can’t tie to your apron-strings
a child that hasn’t a ghost of a claim
on you.”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t,” said Virtue Ann; “I know
I’m standing in my own light, yet there’s
something witchy about the little fellow. I
wake up in the night and think about him,
and vow I’ll never leave him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>“And in the morning it’s forgetting ye
are,” said Bridget with a light laugh. “Faith,
I’d shake him off in the winking of an eye.
It’s the city that’ll look after him, since his
grandfather was an infidel, and they haven’t a
claim on the holy church. Och! murder, me
boy! Virtue Ann!” and Bridget wound up
her remarks with a squeal of dismay; for
Eugene stood in the doorway, his black, piercing
eyes fixed severely on her face.</p>

<p>He did not speak to her, but turned to his
nurse. “Virtue Ann,” he asked in a sad,
penetrating voice, “is it true that you wish
to leave me?”</p>

<p>“Master Eugene,” stammered the girl, “I
thought you were on the sofa asleep, being
tired from your walk in the park this morning;
I’m sure I never dreamed—if I’d thought
you were awake I’d have shut the door.”</p>

<p>“Have you a situation offered to you?”
asked Eugene coldly.</p>

<p>“Yes, she has,” interposed Bridget; “and
that is the truth of the matter; and you’ll be
a good boy, sir, now won’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Eugene still paid no attention to her; and
Virtue Ann went on, “I’ll not leave you,
Master Eugene, don’t you be afeard of it.
I’m just talking to while away the time.”</p>

<p>“Where is it that you wish to go?” asked
Eugene.</p>

<p>“It’s to Brookline,” interposed Bridget.
“To a fine house, where she’ll get lots of
wages, and maybe find a nice home for you,
me boy, if you’ll be a good, peaceable lad,
and let her go quiet-like and aisy.”</p>

<p>“When are you required to be there?”
pursued Eugene.</p>

<p>“Never, Master Eugene,” said Virtue Ann
hysterically. “I’m not going. It’s only talk.”</p>

<p>“And it’s to-morrow morning her new mistress
would like to have her,” said Bridget;
“for in the evening she gives a grand dinnerparty,
and they’ll be glad of extra help for the
waiting.”</p>

<p>“How much do I owe you, Virtue Ann?”
asked Eugene.</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing,” said the girl wildly.
“Oh! I don’t know what brought us into this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
scrape. Bridget, I wish you’d held your
tongue.”</p>

<p>The boy took out his little purse, and
opened it. There was not much money in it.
He turned over a few silver pieces with the
tips of his slim, aristocratic fingers, and his
white face grew whiter. Still he said firmly,
“It will be necessary to sell the furniture. I
will arrange for it. You may leave me in
the morning, Virtue Ann;” and he withdrew
as softly as he had come.</p>

<p>“The little impident thing,” said Bridget
wrathfully. “He niver once cast a glance at
me.”</p>

<p>“He’ll never speak to you again,” said Virtue
Ann mournfully, “nor to me either, after
I leave him. I know him; he’s the most unforgiving
little mortal that ever drew breath.
Oh! I wish I hadn’t offended him;” and she
put her apron up to her face and began to cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, whisht!” said Bridget impatiently.
“Just you leave him here; some one will take
care of him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t, I can’t!” said Virtue Ann.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
“He’s all alone in the world. He don’t know
any one here, or care for any one, unless it’s
that police sergeant. I guess I’ll go see him
right away.”</p>

<p>“Hist!” said Bridget, “there’s a ring at the
bell; go see who it is.”</p>

<p>Virtue Ann sprang up, dried her tears, and
hurried into the little hall. Mrs. Hardy’s voice
was asking through the tube if she might
come up. “Certainly, certainly, ma’am,” said
Virtue Ann joyfully; and when a few minutes
after she looked over the stair-railing, and saw
Mrs. Hardy’s white head, crowned by a big
black hat, appearing, she exclaimed, “I’m just
tickled to death to see you, ma’am. Would
you,” and she lowered her voice to a mysterious
whisper, “mind coming to the kitchen
for a minute? Master Eugene’s in the parlor,
and I want to tell you something.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy nodded her head, and without
speaking followed the girl to the kitchen, and
stood looking in a puzzled way at Bridget,
whom she had not seen before.</p>

<p>Virtue Ann quickly explained the situation
of affairs to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy listened attentively; and when
Virtue Ann finished speaking, she said, “Will
you take me to the boy? I have just come to
ask him to visit us as long as he likes.”</p>

<p>Virtue Ann was almost beside herself with
relief. “You’ve the best heart in the world,
ma’am,” she said enthusiastically. “This is the
most pleasurable thing that could happen to
him. Oh, I’m out of my senses for joy!” and
she seized Mrs. Hardy’s hand in her own.</p>

<p>The sergeant’s wife smiled at her; then she
asked again, somewhat impatiently, where Eugene
was.</p>

<p>“Here, ma’am,” said Virtue Ann; and she
threw open the door of the small parlor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy’s face changed quickly. The
boy sat by the table, his young head bent over
a piece of paper, on which he was laboriously
writing figures. She knew that his childish
head was throbbing with the vain effort to find
some way by which he could increase the sum
of money that he had on hand.</p>

<p>Poor little one! and vain task beyond his
years, she thought pitifully; but she restrained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
herself from any open expression of sympathy,
for she knew that he would not appreciate
it.</p>

<p>He got up slowly when he saw her, and offered
her his seat; and with a sharp pang at her
heart she noticed the curious facility and unchildishness
with which he put his own trouble
from him, and waited courteously to hear the
object of her visit.</p>

<p>“I have come to see you,” she began absently,
then she paused. Could this indeed
be the same little boy that her husband had
seen scampering merrily over the Fens only
that morning?</p>

<p>“Did you win any of the races to-day?”
she said irrelevantly.</p>

<p>Some color came into Eugene’s face, and
made him look like a delicate bit of porcelain.
“I did,” he said eagerly. “I amused myself
very much; and I am invited to go again to-morrow
if—if other matters will permit;” and
he grew grave again.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by other matters?”
asked Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>“My servant wishes to leave me,” said
Eugene. “I shall dismiss her in the morning.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy did not know whether to laugh
or to cry. She certainly took a strange interest
in this boy. “And what will you do,”
she asked, “after the girl goes away?”</p>

<p>“I shall remain here,” said Eugene, “until
my letter arrives from France.”</p>

<p>“But you cannot stay alone.”</p>

<p>“Why not, madam?”</p>

<p>“Who ever heard of such a thing?” she
said; “you are a mere child. You cannot.
Who will cook for you?”</p>

<p>“There are <i>cafés</i> and bake-houses near by,”
said Eugene calmly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy stretched an appealing black-gloved
hand to him. “Come to us,” she
said. “I am here to-day to ask you to make
us a long visit. My husband joins with me
in this invitation.”</p>

<p>“You are most kind, most sagacious,” said
Eugene slowly; “but it is impossible.”</p>

<p>“Why is it impossible?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>“What demand have I on you?” he said
civilly, yet haughtily.</p>

<p>“Every one that is in trouble has a claim to
hospitality,” said Mrs. Hardy warmly. “We
have to help each other in this world. We
could not go on if we did not.”</p>

<p>“And what is your imagination about my
trouble?” he asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy had offended the proud little
lad, but she did not stop to choose her next
words. “Your trouble is that you are old
before your time,” she said hurriedly. “You
are just like a graybeard. Only the bitter in
life seems to be left for you. Come to me,
and let me make you a child again;” and she
seized one of his slim hands in hers.</p>

<p>To her distress, nay, her horror, the boy
drew back from her with a slight sneer.
“Madam,” he said icily, “my grandfather
often said to me, ‘Distrust women; you may
have the happiness to amuse them for a time,
but later on they will throw you aside.’ I
have not great age myself, but so far I think
he has reason.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>“And do you think that I only want to
amuse myself in taking care of you?” gasped
Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>“Why not?” and Eugene elevated his
eyebrows. “It is either that, or you wish to
establish a claim on me, so that I may share
my fortune with you.”</p>

<p>“Your fortune!” ejaculated Mrs. Hardy;
“you have none.”</p>

<p>“You know that I expect one,” said Eugene
in a condescending manner.</p>

<p>“Then, you don’t think I came here to-day
just out of the kindness of my heart—that
I am willing to take care of you, and treat
you just as if you were my own little boy,
simply from love.”</p>

<p>Eugene shrugged his shoulders. “No; why
should you? I have no right to this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you naughty, naughty boy!” said
Mrs. Hardy, pushing back her chair and angrily
confronting him. “I never heard any
one talk like you in my life. I don’t know
what your grandfather could have been thinking
of to bring you up like this. You are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
not like the Boston bad boy at all; you are
much worse. I wouldn’t have you in my
house;” and the little woman flung herself
out of the room.</p>

<p>Virtue Ann and Bridget could not detain
her. She fairly ran home; and, throwing herself
on a sofa, she mourned in silence and
alone until her husband came in for his supper.
Then she gave him an account of her
visit.</p>

<p>The sergeant laughed until he grew purple
in the face. “Bess,” he said, “you want an
adopted mother yourself. You’re not used to
managing children. You mustn’t fly into a
temper so quickly.”</p>

<p>“He was so aggravating,” sobbed Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>“Of course; but think of the way he’s been
brought up. Why, he’s just like a hunted
animal now. The weakest thing will turn at
the last. Have you ever seen a rat in a corner?
He’ll fix his teeth in the biggest stick
you can poke at him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t compare that prince of a boy
with a rat,” said his wife dolefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>“There, now,” pursued the sergeant, “you’re
not mad with him. You won’t let any one
abuse him but yourself. You still want him,
I see; so he has got to come here—and anyway,
law and order must be preserved. Even
the cats in the park understand that. What
do you think I found the king doing just
now?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” sighed Mrs. Hardy in an
absent-minded way.</p>

<p>“Well, I came across Squirrel, King Boozy’s
chum, sitting on a stump, badly mauled. He
was by turns polishing himself off with his
tongue, and watching the king, who was licking
a strange cat. Another strange cat, that
had already been whipped, was running away,
and I figured the matter out this way. Squirrel
had been attacked by the two strangers;
and as soon as he could get away, he had
brought the king up, who was punishing them
thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what the cats have to do with
the boy,” said Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>“They have a good deal. Don’t you see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
that Boozy is an old head now; he was disciplining
the young strangers that had interfered
with Squirrel. Now, this French lad is
young—a good bit younger than you and me.
Of course he’s disagreeable. Who wouldn’t
be, brought up as he has been? Parents and
guardians have to lick young ones into shape.
Now, you get the supper ready, and I’ll have
the boy here in a jiffy, and you can punish
him any way that you like. I guess it will
be with kindness;” and with a soothing pat
on her head her husband left her.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="small">EUGENE IS ARRESTED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Bridget had gone home. Virtue Ann was
putting on the table the bread and chocolate
that was to compose Eugene’s frugal meal,
and the boy himself was sitting in a dull fashion
by the window in so deep a revery that
he did not hear the door-bell ring, and did
not see Sergeant Hardy come into the room.</p>

<p>He only started, and looked up when the
words, “At your service, sir,” uttered in deep
voice, fell upon his ear.</p>

<p>At them he roused himself, and rose to his
feet; but the sergeant neither bowed nor offered
to shake hands with him in a friendly
way as he usually did. His only greeting besides
the words that he had spoken was a military
salute. Then he stood stiffly against the
wall as if waiting for something.</p>

<p>“Will you sit down?” asked Eugene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Against orders,” said the sergeant. “I’ve
come to arrest you.”</p>

<p>“To arrest me,” repeated Eugene wonderingly;
“what is it that I have done?”</p>

<p>“Warrant for arrest on two charges,” said
the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Will you mention them,” asked Eugene
frigidly, and yet politely, for he had great respect
for any one in authority.</p>

<p>“First charge,” said the sergeant abruptly,
“disdainful despicability of my wife’s affections;
second charge, murderous and malicious
designs against your own precious and peculiar
self.”</p>

<p>Eugene did not know the meaning of despicability;
but he saw the mischievous glitter
in the sergeant’s eye, and he suspected that
there was a joke somewhere. “Suppose I refuse
to go,” he said with much calmness and
deliberation.</p>

<p>“I’d pick up your little French figure, and
put it under my arm, and you’d be in jail in
no time,” said the sergeant.</p>

<p>“So I am to go to prison,” said Eugene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir—private jail, permitted through
the clemency of the law.”</p>

<p>Eugene smiled a little wearily, then he eyed
the sergeant all over. He had penetration
enough to discover that the man had come
there with the determination of taking him
away, and he knew that he might as well
yield first as last.</p>

<p>“I surrender,” he said grandly; “may I ask
you, Mr. Officer, until when I am to be in
prison?”</p>

<p>“Six weeks,” said the sergeant promptly.</p>

<p>“Will you show me the warrant for my
arrest?” said Eugene.</p>

<p>The sergeant hesitated, then he thrust his
hand into his pocket, and drew out a little
wet handkerchief.</p>

<p>“I found my wife crying when I went
home,” he said. “She was offended and annoyed.
I took this little muslin rag away from
her, and gave her my big ‘mooshawr’ you call
it, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Eugene; “it will be a <i>lettre de
cachet</i> in this case. Virtue Ann,” he went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
addressing the maid who stood gaping at them
in the doorway, “will you put together in a
bag some things for me. It is necessary that
I accompany this gentleman to—you did not
mention the name of the prison,” and he
turned to the sergeant.</p>

<p>“To the Bastille,” said the sergeant, grinning
delightedly at the opportunity of showing
a little knowledge of French history.</p>

<p>“To the Bastille,” repeated Eugene. “So
be it. As a prisoner has no longer rights, will
you arrange for the furniture of these rooms
to be sold, and some money paid to my servant?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the sergeant again saluting
him.</p>

<p>Eugene went to a desk in the corner of the
room, and took out some photographs and
private papers, also a miniature portrait of his
grandfather, which he put into a black bag
that Virtue Ann brought in and laid on the
table.</p>

<p>At last he announced himself ready; and
the sergeant, who had stood by the door during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the preparations made for departure, stepped
forward, and took the bag in his hand.</p>

<p>Virtue Ann began to fidget miserably with
her apron, while Eugene looked at her with
an unmoved face.</p>

<p>“I can’t let you go, pretty little dear,” she
said at last, standing in front of him, and affectionately
smoothing his shoulder with her
rough hand.</p>

<p>“I beg that you will compose yourself,”
said Eugene coolly.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you sorry to leave me?” cried Virtue
Ann wildly. “You little cold, cold fish.”</p>

<p>“Why should I be sorry?” said Eugene,
holding back his head; “you have been false
to me.”</p>

<p>“False! oh, dear, now just hear him,” said
Virtue Ann. “Well, you’ve got to let me
kiss you anyway, you bad-hearted little
thing;” and she stroked his black, glossy
head, and pressed her lips to his forehead in
a motherly way.</p>

<p>Eugene made a slight grimace, and drew
himself away from her, while the sergeant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
looked on with an amused smile, and muttered,
“I’d like to know what it is about
that child that makes the women crazy. It
must be out of sheer, clear contrariness, because
he doesn’t like them, or else it’s his
fascinating manners. He isn’t handsome—not
a bit handsomer than I am; come on,
young sir,” and he began to march down-stairs.</p>

<p>“Before we get in the street,” he said,
pausing in the lobby, “give me your parole,
sir, that you won’t try to escape.”</p>

<p>Eugene hesitated to give it.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t go far,” said the sergeant,
“for I’d be sure to catch you.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the boy; “I yield to the
inevitable. I will not try to escape until a
letter comes from France.”</p>

<p>“All right, mussoo,” replied the sergeant;
and he tramped on.</p>

<p>Eugene was hungry and tired and inwardly
disheartened, though he kept a calm exterior,
and he was well pleased to arrive in front of
the sergeant’s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess we’ll excuse your attendance at
the public table of the jail this evening,” said
the sergeant cheerfully. “Walk right along
this way to your cell, sir.”</p>

<p>Eugene followed him down the hall to a
little bedroom at the back of the house. It
was furnished in pale colors, and a pretty
white bed stood in the middle of it. The
window was open, and a big bowl of flowers
was placed on a small table beside the bed.</p>

<p>“You’re to have solitary imprisonment till
to-morrow morning,” said the sergeant trying
to speak sternly. “Your jailer will bring
you some supper presently. She’s a woman,
so you will treat her harmoniously.”</p>

<p>Eugene, still holding his cap in his hand,
went and stood by one of the open windows.
He was not grateful to the sergeant for introducing
him to so charming a prison. He
was filled with a blind, wild anger at the
fate, as he called it, that had laid him under
an obligation to these strangers whom he regarded
as below himself in the social scale;
and he was all the more angry because, child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
though he was, he had the acuteness to reflect
that in the natural course of things his
dissatisfaction would pass away. The more
he thought about it the more angry he became;
and yet so great control was he able
to exert over his feelings when he was disposed
to do so, that hardly a trace of his inward
disquiet and rebellion appeared on his
impassive face.</p>

<p>“Good-night, prisoner,” said the sergeant
abruptly. “I’m going now. Pleasant dreams
to you.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, jailer,” said Eugene in a repressed
voice; “some day I will thank you,
but not yet.”</p>

<p>The sergeant shrugged his broad shoulders
and walked out to the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Bess,” he said, laughing softly to himself,
as he watched his wife flying around the room
a pink spot on each cheek, “I’ve trapped your
fine foreign bird for you. Tame him now if
you can.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tame him,” said Mrs. Hardy, tossing
her fluffy white head; and she went on with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
her occupation of loading a tray with dainties
for the young prisoner.</p>

<p>“He’ll see his grandfather to-night sure, and
all his ancestors,” said the sergeant grumblingly,
as his eyes wandered over the tray,
“if he eats all that. What are you thinking
of, Bess,—rich plum-pudding and candy for
a child this time of day.”</p>

<p>“I thought perhaps he would like to look
at them,” said Mrs. Hardy; “and there are
plenty of substantial things. See this corn
bread and chicken, and these vegetables.”</p>

<p>“But he mayn’t pick them out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he will! he is a sensible boy at
heart,” said Mrs. Hardy; and she fairly ran
from the room and down the hall with the tray.</p>

<p>Eugene opened the door when she called to
him, and at the sight of his pallid face she
almost dropped the tray.</p>

<p>In silence he cleared the table for her to
rest it on. In silence she put it down and
gazed at him. At last she said nervously, “I
thought you’d rather have your supper in here
alone than to come to the table with us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you for your benevolence,” he said,
inclining his head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy twisted her face like a child
about to cry. “Let me help you unpack your
bag,” she said hastily. “The supper things
won’t get cold for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Eugene opened the bag, and she shook out
the clothes as carefully as if they had belonged
to a child of her own. Then she showed him
some hooks behind a curtain where he could
hang them. “And there is the bath-room,”
she went on, opening the hall door. “Perhaps
you will like to take a warm bath by and by.
I will put some fresh towels in for you. Now
I shall leave you alone, and not bother you
until the morning. Good-night;” and she
looked at him wistfully.</p>

<p>Eugene opened the door for her, and stood
in polite weariness beside it. Then one by
one big tears began to roll down his cheeks.
He did not know why they came there, and
he made no effort to brush them away.</p>

<p>“Do you remember your mother?” asked
Mrs. Hardy softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, madam; she died when I was an infant.”</p>

<p>“And have you never had a woman to love
you and call you her child, and tuck you in
your little bed at night?” asked Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>“I have always had a <i>bonne</i>, a nurse,” said
Eugene—“many of them; but my grandfather
is the only mother I have had.”</p>

<p>“And is there no one in the world that
you love now—no one that you cling to?”</p>

<p>“I have the memory of my grandfather and
of his Majesty the emperor.”</p>

<p>“You’re the queerest little boy I ever saw.
You are something like the Chinese. They
worship their ancestors.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” said Eugene with a doubtful
glance, as if he questioned the truth of her
statement.</p>

<p>“And you really don’t care for any one,”
said Mrs. Hardy. “You must excuse my curiosity;
but I never saw man, woman, or child
like you.”</p>

<p>“I must care for myself,” said Eugene solemnly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know what is the matter with you,”
said Mrs. Hardy triumphantly. “It’s just the
trouble your great emperor suffered from. He
hadn’t much faith in human nature, and he
despised women.”</p>

<p>“The great emperor was but a man,” said
Eugene stiffly.</p>

<p>“He was concentrated selfishness,” said Mrs.
Hardy. “I am selfish, my husband is, everybody
is; but Napoleon was worse than we are.
But why do you cry?” for the tears were
still rolling down Eugene’s cheeks in a slow
and sober procession.</p>

<p>He dabbed at his face with his handkerchief.
“I will tell you,” he said earnestly. “Since
you have been speaking, I have been looking
out that window toward the park where your
homeless cats live. I did not comprehend
about them the other day; now my soul enters
the cats’ bodies, as we might say, and I
feel the dismay that must fill them when they
have lost their homes and their protectors. It
is horrible. One becomes filled with anguish
and bewilderment. Where shall one turn?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know what that feeling is that
makes you, as you suppose, cry for the cats?”
asked Mrs. Hardy with great gentleness.</p>

<p>While Eugene paused to frame a reply, she
went on, “It is sympathy. You are beginning
to understand, and you are on the high road
that leads away from selfishness. Usually we
begin with the human family and descend to
the animals. You are going backward. Your
pity for the cats makes you see in them something
more than mere hairy creatures crawling
over the ground, as you styled them the
other day.”</p>

<p>“I see in them suffering beings,” said Eugene
intensely. “Their situation is like mine.”
He stopped abruptly, and leaned his head on
the arm that he had stretched out against the
wall.</p>

<p>“When my husband was a lad he disliked
animals and was cruel to them,” said Mrs.
Hardy. “Then he had a serious illness. Two
kittens that his mother owned used to sit on
his bed, and watch him affectionately. He
got to love them; and now he has the kindest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
heart for dumb animals, and also for men and
women, of any man I know. Now I will
leave you, for you are tired. Good-night, dear
boy. God bless you;” and she went quietly
away, and left him alone as she knew he
wished to be.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="small">THE SERGEANT TALKS OF WAR AND OTHER<br />
THINGS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The next morning Eugene was ill. He was
not a very strong boy, and he had had more
excitement and mental anxiety during the last
few days than his slender frame and sensitive
soul could withstand.</p>

<p>For some days he was obliged to keep his
bed, where he was faithfully waited on by the
keepers of his pretty prison.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy was the chief jailer; and although
he uttered only polite conventional expressions
of gratitude that she knew did not come from
his heart, she felt sure that she would in time
win her way into his stubborn affections.</p>

<p>“The great thing is to keep my temper
with him,” she said to her husband one day;
“he is so provoking sometimes, without meaning
to be so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>“All boys are,” said the sergeant consolingly,
“and most men and women too, for
that matter. Nobody can keep their temper
all the time. According to my doctrine, you
lose it just as seldom as you can; and when
you do, don’t kick up a fuss about it, but
just do some little thing that lets people
know you’re sorry, and then take a fresh
sheet and start over again.”</p>

<p>“When I speak sharply to him, I think it
my duty to apologize,” said Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>“Now, Bess, none of that,” said her husband,
“if you don’t want to get priggish. I
know you. You’re quick and sensitive, and
you think you’ve got to say ‘forgive me’
every time you look the wrong way. That
boy will despise you if you keep running to
him with apologies. I used to know a fellow
out West, Wash-house Billy we called him,
because he was forever scrubbing himself—well,
that chap was so self-righteous that
every time he played a mean trick on any
one, he’d go trotting after him with a ‘forgive
me’ dropping from his lips. He got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
knocked down one time for apologizing to a
half-breed that wasn’t used to it. Then he
had to explain; and the half-breed swore at
him, and said he didn’t want any of his half-cooked
words. If he was sorry, let him act
it. Deeds, not words, were what he wanted.
The rest of us were very glad; for Wash-house
Billy had got into the bad habit of
treating us all as mean as pickpockets, because
he was always ready to jump from his
low trick to his high one, and we were so
dumfounded by his prig religion that we
hadn’t the spirit to knock him down as the
half-breed did. If the boy provokes you, he
deserves a snub.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t provoking,” said Mrs. Hardy
warmly, “except occasionally. He’s the sweetest
boy, Stephen, and he is going to make a
fine man I am sure; and he asks the quaintest
questions while he lies in bed with his big
black eyes following me round the room.”</p>

<p>“Is he getting up to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he will be out in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>The sergeant went on with his dinner, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
did not look up until Eugene came into the
room. “How are you?” he said. “I haven’t
seen you before to-day. Don’t you want to
put on your cap, and come to the park with
me?”</p>

<p>“I will go with pleasure,” replied Eugene.
Before he could get to the hall, Mrs. Hardy
had run there, and had brought his cap,
which she dropped lightly on his head.</p>

<p>Eugene lifted it off; then, as if to apologize
to her for not donning it until he reached
the door, he bent over her hand, and lifting
it to his lips, kissed it without speaking.</p>

<p>It was the first caress he had given her,
and her face flushed with pleasure as she stood
looking after him. “He has such pretty foreign
ways,” she murmured. “I wish he
would love me.”</p>

<p>“It is agreeable to be able to walk out
once more,” said Eugene, drawing a long
breath, as he sauntered slowly along by the
side of the sergeant.</p>

<p>The man looked down at him in a kindly
fashion. “You’ll be all right now,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
“and you must spend a lot of time outside.
Why, here’s the king coming to meet us; we
must be late to-day.”</p>

<p>The cat turned, and walked by the side of
the sergeant, occasionally sniffing at the paper
parcels he carried in his hand.</p>

<p>“Will you have the kindness to stop for a
minute?” asked Eugene suddenly.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” said the sergeant.</p>

<p>The boy pointed to the bust of John Boyle
O’Reilly that they were approaching. “Some
one has put fresh flowers there,” he said excitedly.
“I have been ill and detained from
doing it. Who is it?”</p>

<p>“My wife and your jailer. She knows about
your liking for the emperor and O’Reilly, and
she comes here with a bouquet every morning
before you’re up.”</p>

<p>“Does she do this to please me?”</p>

<p>“For no other reason that I know of.”</p>

<p>Eugene was silent for a short time as if he
were working out some problem. Then he
said earnestly, “Have you ever found her
deceitful?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not as yet,” said the sergeant cheerfully.
“Of course we never know how folks may
turn out.”</p>

<p>“No; one never does,” said Eugene with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“Generally speaking, we turn out as we begin,”
said the man. “There’s a fine opening
for a sermon, my boy, only I’m not good at
preaching. You’ll have to draw your own
conclusions.”</p>

<p>Eugene gave him a long and scrutinizing
look; then he said, with a compassionate glance
at King Boozy who was mewing coaxingly
about the bags, “Suppose we proceed.”</p>

<p>“All right, my boy;” and the sergeant walked
nimbly on until they reached the cats’ dining-room
under the shrubbery, where he spread
on the ground a sheet of brown paper, and
emptied on it a medley of chicken and beef
bones. Then drawing a tin can from among
the leaves, he filled it with milk from a bottle
in his pocket.</p>

    <span class="smcap small">The Two Cats crouched beside Their Festal Board.</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>King Boozy mewed to his chum Squirrel;
and the two cats crouched down beside their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
festal board, and daintily proceeded to eat up
everything.</p>

<p>“Do you do this every day?” asked Eugene.</p>

<p>“Every day as regular as the sun.”</p>

<p>“It is a thoughtfulness on the part of the
city to provide for homeless beasts.”</p>

<p>“The city! bless you, my boy, the city
doesn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Do you supply this food yourself?” asked
Eugene in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, young sir; why not?”</p>

<p>“For cats, for vermin, or what I was formerly
accustomed to call vermin?” continued
the boy in polite astonishment.</p>

<p>“Vermin must live,” said the sergeant.
“Brute vermin protect the human vermin. If
I had time I’d tell you some of the uses of
cats; but I haven’t, and I guess you’d get
bored if I had. Let us go down to the lower
cat-house. I have some more food in this other
bag.”</p>

<p>“Unless you are a rich man,” said Eugene
as they entered a shady path, “I think that
the city should feed the cats that serve it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>“The city might if it was asked,” said the
sergeant good-naturedly; “but I’d like to see
myself sending in a requisition for cats’ meat.
It only costs a few dollars a week to feed
them.”</p>

<p>Eugene murmured an almost indistinct reply,
and fell into a brown study that lasted
until they reached the second colony of cats.</p>

<p>“You musn’t walk any farther,” said the
sergeant, after he had scattered the second
supply of food on the ground, and the cats
had come scampering and cuffing each other
aside to reach it. “Come into the office and
rest. I have to wait here a while.”</p>

<p>Eugene went with him into a little wooden
building, and sat down by the window where
he could watch the animals outside. “Their
coats are very thick,” he said musingly, “or
is it that they are sticking out their hairs?”</p>

<p>“No; their coats are really heavy. They
get that way after they have lived out-doors
for some time.”</p>

<p>“Have these animals all been cast out by
some one?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Every man Jack of them,” said the sergeant;
“cast out, or frightened out, or scolded
out, or kicked out. They come mewing and
cringing to this park, most of them scared
out of their lives, only here and there a bold
one.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunates,” said Eugene bitterly, “it
would be better for them to die.”</p>

<p>“They think it more fun to live and have
a good time. They don’t mind dependence.
Bless you, we’ve all got to be looked after.
Where would I be if I hadn’t my wife to
take care of me? what would she do without
me?”</p>

<p>“Have no thought for her,” said Eugene
magnificently. “If misfortune befalls you, I
shall take her under my protection.”</p>

<p>The sergeant stared hard at the cats, and
tried not to smile.</p>

<p>“After my fortune comes from France, I
shall remember you,” said Eugene.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied the sergeant demurely.
“May I ask you whether you intend
remaining in this country?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; I shall not live under that villanous
republic. My grand-uncle will send me
not the whole, he is too avaricious for that,
but a part of the fortune that rightfully belongs
to me. I shall go to a military school,
of which I am assured there are good ones
in this country; then, when I become a man,
the republic of France will probably be no
more. We shall have our empire, and I
shall return, and take service under the Bonapartes.”</p>

<p>“You are quite sure that your grand-uncle
will send you some money?”</p>

<p>At this remark Eugene turned such a startled
face toward his companion that the latter,
finding that he had surprised the boy out of
his usual composure, made haste to change
the subject of conversation.</p>

<p>“So you want to be a soldier,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes; it is the only profession for a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Napoleon made a pretty big thing of war,”
said the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Oh! an enormous thing. I should like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
be a second Napoleon;” and Eugene’s eyes
sparkled.</p>

<p>“I don’t take much stock in war,” said
the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you would not fight?”</p>

<p>“No; I mean I don’t like it.”</p>

<p>“You do not—how very extraordinary.
How does it happen?”</p>

<p>“Because I’ve been in it.”</p>

<p>“You have seen active service, have been
in engagements,” exclaimed Eugene. “Oh!
why did you not tell me?”</p>

<p>“It never occurred to me,” said the sergeant;
“and unlike most men I’m not fond
of talking of it.”</p>

<p>“Your rank,” said Eugene feverishly, “and
the country you fought in, will you not tell
me?”</p>

<p>“Rank, drummer-boy; country, my own native
land and its last war; enemies, brother-men.
Boy, I don’t like war.”</p>

<p>“Why not, oh, why not?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you presently. You tell me first
what your idea of war is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>“We have a picture of my great-grandfather
in white huzzar uniform,” said Eugene enthusiastically.
“He is magnificent. In the hall
of our château in France hangs also a painting
of my great-great-grandfather, mounted on his
charger Austerlitz. He waves his arm in the
air; he encourages his men. They are about
to charge the enemy. He reminds them that
they fight for their country, their emperor—oh!
it makes one’s blood stir to look at it.”</p>

<p>“That’s mostly the picture outsiders draw,”
said the sergeant mildly. “They always fancy
handsome officers, stainless uniforms, a lot of
enemies waiting somewhere to be cut down
like sheep. It’s all glory and paint and a lot
of big figures in histories and newspapers.
But there’s another side to it after you’ve
been in a battle. In the first place, I should
say war is a dirty thing.”</p>

<p>“A dirty thing,” said Eugene wonderingly.
“What is that for an epithet?”</p>

<p>“It’s a suitable one,” replied the sergeant
coolly. “In the first place, war is dirty; in the
second, it’s low; and in the third, it’s needless.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>“I do not understand you;” and Eugene
made a gesture expressive of slight contempt.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said the sergeant, dragging
his chair up to the table, and bringing a lead-pencil
from a drawer. “Here on this side of
the table imagine gray men, imagine blue
there. They haven’t one earthly thing against
each other, but they’ve got to rend and tear
each other’s mortal bodies to preserve the
independence of the Union. The subject of
their dispute is a grand one, a glorious one;
and if there wasn’t any other way to settle it
they’d have to whack each other, and beat the
life out of each other’s bodies, but there is
another way.”</p>

<p>“Wars must take place,” said Eugene firmly.
“My grandfather asserts it.”</p>

<p>“Your grandfather is—that is, you are mistaken.
Wars don’t need to take place. In
the late one in this country, when we were all
seething hotheads, why didn’t we apply to
foreign countries to settle our dispute?”</p>

<p>“Arbitration—ah! that is not for gentlemen,”
said the boy proudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>The sergeant smiled. “Lad,” he said, “you’re
just like all the rest of growing things. You
have got to learn for yourself. You won’t
take a leaf out of any other body’s book. Do
you believe me when I say that if you were
to enlist to-day, and go on the field to-morrow,
that your little body would quiver and shake,
and you’d want to turn tail and run, like
one of those cats, when you heard the big
guns?”</p>

<p>“I would never run.”</p>

<p>“Possibly you might not,” said the sergeant
amiably. “I’m not going to say that all men
do, though I believe most men want to. Well,
we’ll say you’ve got through the first engagement,
and have a nice undangerous wound in
the fleshy part of your leg. You’d admire
the battlefield, wouldn’t you, and the agony of
men and horses heaped up, and you’d go to
the hospital and see the wounded, and smell
the sickening smells, and enjoy yourself?”</p>

<p>“A soldier must look on blood.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he must—tears and blood. Why,
lad, if all the women that lost husbands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
fathers and lovers could hover over a battlefield,
there would be a good sharp shower like
rain on it.”</p>

<p>“It is necessary for women to cry,” remarked
Eugene.</p>

<p>“Yes; that’s true. I guess men would be
a little better to shed tears now and again.
Well, lad, I hope no woman will ever have to
cry because your body has been made a target
of. I hope, too, that you’ll never be stood up
and have an awful moment when you wonder
what in the name of common-sense you have
done, or your ancestors have done, that you
shouldn’t be allowed to live out this life, which
is tricky anyway, but should be set up for a
plaything, not for butchers, but for decent
human beings, that haven’t the faintest bit of
spite against you. But good gracious, I’m
preaching a sermon, which is always against
my principles.”</p>

<p>“I like to talk of war,” said Eugene; “it
makes me feel warm. You have of course read
of Napoleon and his glorious campaigns?”</p>

<p>The sergeant nodded. Eugene had turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
his back to the window, and sat confronting
him with flaming cheeks. He had forgotten
the very existence of the cats.</p>

<p>“He was the greatest soldier the world has
ever seen,” pursued the lad.</p>

<p>“Well, granted he was,” said the sergeant,
“what did he get out of it?”</p>

<p>“Glory, honor, victory, and reputation for
France.”</p>

<p>“And a lonely prison without a razor to
shave his upper lip, according to you,” said the
sergeant, “though I think you are rather hard
on England in that.”</p>

<p>“At the last, yes,” said Eugene; ”but his
career up to that was magnificent.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see the magnificence of it,” said the
sergeant. “He set all Europe by the ears; he
stirred up the kings and emperors; he turned
things topsy-turvy, and in the end left France
no better than he found her. His ambition
was too big for his little body. He should have
stopped half way in his course.”</p>

<p>“You do not understand,” said Eugene impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>“And he strewed dead Frenchmen all over
Europe,” said the sergeant, “and not one-half
of them knew what they were fighting about.
What do you think of the retreat from Moscow,
my boy?”</p>

<p>“A splendid failure. But the emperor did
not know all things. How could he tell what
was going to be?”</p>

<p>“I’ll come back to my starting-point,” said
the sergeant. “I believe we’re put on this
earth—cats and dogs and beasts and men—to
be happy. Any one or anything that lifts
his hand against his brother throws the whole
world out of tune. A man that kills anybody
or any creature without cause is a murderer—I
don’t care who he is that does it; and that’s
the sum of the whole thing, according to me,
and I’m not going to say another word. You
run home like a good lad, or the wife will be
getting worried about you. We’ll talk of these
things another time.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="small">THE KING TO THE RESCUE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>On a yellow, dreamy day of late autumn,
while the sergeant was strolling through the
Fens, he came suddenly upon little Virgie
Manning and her nurse.</p>

<p>“Hello, little miss!” said the sergeant. “I
haven’t seen you for a long time; but where
did you get those flowers? They look like
some of the park golden-rod.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Virgie in her half-lisping voice;
“they are your flowers, Mr. Policeman.”</p>

<p>“But you musn’t pick the park flowers,”
said the sergeant.</p>

<p>“And sure I told her that myself,” said
Bridget. “Now, missy, you see what happens
to naughty girls. Are you going to
take her to prison, Mr. Officer?”</p>

<p>Virgie laughed gleefully. She was not at
all afraid of the sergeant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, not this time,” he said.</p>

<p>“Mr. Policeman,” said Virgie, “one time
long ago weren’t you a weeny boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was.”</p>

<p>“Did you love the pretty flowerses?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“And you picked them,” said Virgie, “and
naughty big men scolded you?”</p>

<p>“No, they didn’t; I lived in the country.”</p>

<p>“Then, you mustn’t scold me,” said Virgie
gayly. “O Bridget! there is a big, big fly
with blue wingses. You stand still like a
mousie while I catch it, ’cause if you runned
you might starkle it;” and she darted away.</p>

<p>“And is the French boy still making his
home with you, sir?” asked Bridget curiously.</p>

<p>“Yes; he is still with us.”</p>

<p>“And he doesn’t hear from his bad old
uncle in France, Virtue Ann tells me.”</p>

<p>“No; he hasn’t as yet,” said the sergeant.</p>

<p>“And it’s a great comfort to Virtue Ann
that you’ve shielded him,” continued Bridget,
“otherwise she’d have cold comfort in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
good place she’s found for herself. ‘Virtue
Ann,’ said I, ‘if you despise your luck this
time, you’ll be guilty of the sin of onprudency.
Make seven crosses, and let the boy
go, and you’ll find you’re in the right of it.’”</p>

<p>“The boy is always glad to see her,” said
the sergeant absently. “Hello, Boozy, what’s
the matter?”</p>

<p>“And sure that’s a queer cat,” said Bridget,
eyeing the black-and-white animal who was
mewing excitedly, and walking up and down
at a little distance from them.</p>

<p>“He wants to show me something, and
badly too,” said the sergeant, “or he wouldn’t
come so near a woman. Go on, Boozy, I’ll
follow.”</p>

<p>At this moment little Virgie came running
up crying, “The naughty fly flewed away.
He wouldn’t play wif me. Oh! there’s the
sweet pussy;” and she precipitated herself
toward Boozy.</p>

<p>The king was in great distress. He sprang
nimbly from side to side, waving his tail
angrily in the air as he tried to elude the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
little girl’s caresses, and at the same time
keep the attention of the sergeant fixed on
himself.</p>

<p>“I understand you, Boozy,” said the sergeant.
“Walk on, and I’ll come. Look here,
little girl, you stop chasing him, will you,
and take my hand? We’ll see what he’s
leading us to.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has some little kittens to show
us,” suggested Virgie.</p>

<p>“No; the king isn’t fond of kittens. Probably
it’s a mole or a mouse he’s caught, or
perhaps his chum is in trouble. One day he
was caught in a wire fence, and Boozy came
for me to set him free. Can you trot along
a little faster, he seems to be in a hurry?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the child, hopping and skipping
along by his side, her blue eyes wandering to
and fro across the broad avenue. “Where’s
Eugene?” she asked suddenly, “Virgie hasn’t
seen him for lots and lots of time.”</p>

<p>“He’s in the park somewhere,” said the
sergeant. “He spends a great deal of time
here. He has taken a great fancy to Boozy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
and sits for hours watching him. I guess the
cat teaches him a good many lessons.”</p>

<p>“The king is a good pussy,” remarked
Virgie sagely.</p>

<p>“He is not perfect, but he is about as good
as a cat can be,” said her companion.</p>

<p>Virgie stopped to pick up some shining pebbles
from the ground, but the sergeant hurried
her on. “Make haste, little girl, if you want
to come with me. There’s something queer
about the king’s actions. See how he is running.”</p>

<p>Virgie trotted along beside him again, and
her nurse quickened her footsteps so that she
might keep up with the two figures ahead of
her.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” exclaimed the sergeant,
suddenly dropping the child’s hand, and scrambling
down a slope beside them; “just look at
that boy.”</p>

<p>“The boy! and sure there’s no boy to be
seen,” said Bridget, who had heard his exclamation,
and paused in surprise at the top of the
little hill, and looked about her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Just below them was a marshy, sedgy pond.
A few ducks were dabbling in the mud at one
end of it, and at the other end something brown
and indistinct was moving in a slow and confused
way among the rushes.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s Eugene,” cried little Virgie,
tearfully clasping her tiny hands. “I guess
he runned and frowed hisself in the water.”</p>

<p>“Hush, lovie,” said her nurse, putting her
arm around her. “There isn’t much water
here, it’s mostly mud, nor any boy for that
matter. Watch and see what the quare thing
is.”</p>

<p>The indistinct figure kept going to and fro,
slightly disturbing the rushes, while the sergeant
rushed back and forth over the encircling
firm ground as if looking for something.</p>

<p>“And sure he’s crazy,” muttered Bridget.
Then she tried to hush Virgie, who was crying
apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Do you see a rope anywhere up there?”
shouted the sergeant. “I had one here this
morning. Some rascal must have taken it.”</p>

<p>Bridget ran about a little among the underbrush.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
“No, sir,” she called back; “there’s
not a shadow of a rope nor a bit of a plank
here.”</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll have to go in myself,” said the
sergeant in a disgusted voice. “Eugene, can’t
you walk out? Come this way. You can see
me, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the blessed saints presarve us!” cried
Bridget, “that quare round thing is the head
of the boy; and it’s mud he is—and there’s an
arm sticking out—and now he’s almost gone.”</p>

<p>Little Virgie gave a shriek. Eugene was indeed
sinking more deeply into the marsh that
would soon close its lips over him if he should
fall down. The sergeant made one brief exclamation,
and snatching off his coat and his
helmet threw them on the ground. Then he
waded in to the spot where Eugene had been
staggering about, and stretching out an arm he
drew him out toward the dry ground.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_134a.jpg" alt="Sinking" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="smcap small">Eugene was sinking more deeply into the Marsh.</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>“May I be forgiven for laughing,” said
Bridget, clutching Virgie by the hand, and
hurrying down the grassy bank, “but I nivver
saw such a soight in my life—and sure the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
boy is brown from the top of his head to the
sole of his foot. Mr. Officer, he hasn’t fainted,
has he?”</p>

<p>“He’s half choked with the mud and the
slime,” said the sergeant dryly. “Lend me
your handkerchief, will you?”</p>

<p>He was bending over Eugene, whom he had
laid on the ground. Rapidly and skilfully he
wiped the boy’s face, and cleaned his head
with leaves from a shrub near by.</p>

<p>“Take, please take my little hankerskniff,”
gasped Virgie, extending a microscopic bit of
cambric.</p>

<p>To please her the sergeant wiped Eugene’s
eyes with it; then he said, “Can you speak
now, boy?”</p>

<p>Eugene struggled to a sitting posture, and
stared solemnly from under sticky eyelashes
at them.</p>

<p>Bridget tried not to laugh; but she was not
used to controlling herself, and she had also
been a little frightened. She began with a
little squeal, then she became hysterical, and
laughed and cried in the same breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>“If ye’s could only see yourselves,” she
said spasmodically; “so gummed up, like
two alligators. I ask yer pardon humbly, but
it’s too ludicrous that ye are—and that boy
that’s always like a picture, so nate and clane,
and yerself, Mr. Officer, that wears the fine
uniform—sure, you’re worse than the men in
the subway with the clay trousers.”</p>

<p>The sergeant smiled grimly. “I don’t wonder
you’re amused,” he said. “Tell me, Eugene,
how you got into this pickle.”</p>

<p>The boy cleaned two of his fingers on the
grass, and took a last remnant of earth from
his mouth. “It was my cap that I was after,”
he said. “The wind blew it among the rushes.
I went to get it on what I thought was a
point of green grass. It was soft mud beneath.
I went in to my ankles, and I could
with difficulty draw my feet out. Then I
walked the wrong way, and fell into a deep
hole. When I rose, I found myself in to my
waist, and bewildered and sinking.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not stand still and call for
help?” asked the sergeant. “There are always
people about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should have felt like a coward,” said
Eugene, proudly holding up his mud-plastered
head.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would have been as cowardly
to call for assistance as to drop down
there and smother to death,” said the sergeant.</p>

<p>“I thought of the emperor,” said Eugene.
“‘Why do you duck your head?’ he once
asked a soldier who bent to avoid a round
shot. ‘If your fate is not there you might
as well stand up straight. If it is there, it
will find you though you bury yourself one
hundred feet in the earth.’”</p>

<p>“All very fine,” said the sergeant; “but at
the same time, Napoleon wasn’t the man to
stick in a mud-hole while he had a good
voice in his body that would help him out.
Come, boy, we had better make our way home
if you feel up to it, and get rid of these clothes
before the mud dries on us.”</p>

<p>“And it’s home we’ll have to be going too,”
said Bridget in a disapproving voice. She
had not been able to keep her warm-hearted
little charge from embracing her muddy playmate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and Virgie’s red cloak was in consequence
disfigured by a number of dark streaks.</p>

<p>“I wish to hug the good pussy,” said Virgie,
drawing back as she caught sight of King
Boozy, who sat on the bridge above, watching
them.</p>

<p>The sergeant laughed. “Boozy hates dirt
and disorder. He did his share of the work,
then retired to watch us. Was he with you,
boy, when your cap blew off?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Eugene; “he was following
me as I walked to and fro on the path.”</p>

<p>“And when he saw you were stuck, he
came for me,” said the sergeant. “He is the
most knowing cat I ever saw. Hello, here’s
a cart coming just in good time to give us a
lift. You look fagged out, Eugene. Give me
your hand; now jump in.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, dear Eugene,” called Virgie.
“If you don’t play in the naughty mud any
more, Virgie won’t frow stones at your remperor;”
and she threw kisses to him until he
was out of sight.</p>

<p>“The missis will be astonished to see us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>”
said the sergeant, as they jogged along in
the cart, “but she’ll have us cleaned up in
no time. Boy,” and he looked slyly at
Eugene, “you didn’t like cats much when
you came to us. Would you mind telling
me your private opinion of them now?”</p>

<p>A smile flitted over Eugene’s weary, dirty
face. “A human being could have done no
more for me this morning than the king did,”
he said simply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="small">MONSIEUR LE CURÉ ARRIVES.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The sergeant usually spent his evenings
at home. All day long he was on his feet,
and it was a pleasure to him when he came
in at night to settle himself in a comfortable
armchair, after he had his supper, and devote
himself to some interesting book until bedtime.</p>

<p>He often read aloud to his wife, who sat
and sewed beside him; and one evening, after
he had been reading for some time, he laid
his book face downward on the small table
before him, and said, “Where is the boy?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy dropped her work, and moved
aside the lamp that partly hid her husband’s
face from her. “He is in his room,” she
said.</p>

<p>“He usually listens to me,” said the sergeant;
“he isn’t moping, is he, or offended
at anything?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no! he never does that now,” laughed
Mrs. Hardy. “He is as cheerful as possible.”</p>

<p>“Queer, isn’t it,” said the sergeant, “how
any one gets used to anything? Does he ever
speak to you about hearing from France?”</p>

<p>“Not now; he used to when he first came.
He thinks of it, though.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I can tell. I understand him so well.”</p>

<p>“How long is it since he came here?”</p>

<p>“Five weeks last Wednesday.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem as long as that,” said the
sergeant thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“The time passes more quickly with a
child in the house,” observed his wife.</p>

<p>“I believe it does. I’m not sorry we took
him, Bess.”</p>

<p>“I know you are not, Stephen. I would
send him away if I thought you were.”</p>

<p>Her husband sent her an affectionate glance,
but made no remark for some time. Then he
said, “What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Darning a pillow-case; it is getting old.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you buy some new ones?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>“I must economize now,” she said. “It
takes more to keep us since the boy came.”</p>

<p>“But you will have plenty by and by.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t it yet, Stephen. One can’t
count on the future.”</p>

<p>“I believe it is a pleasure to you,” he said
under his breath.</p>

<p>His wife caught the word pleasure, and said,
“What did you say, Stephen?”</p>

<p>“I believe you like to scrimp yourself for
any one you like.”</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” she said, laughing, and
tossing her white head. “I should only be
half a woman if I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“He is a handsome lad, isn’t he?” said the
sergeant.</p>

<p>“Indeed he is. Every one looks at him in
the street. Wasn’t it a joke that old Mrs.
Purdy should think he was our boy? I shall
never forget the way Eugene looked at her
when she fell on his neck, and said he was
the image of his father.”</p>

<p>“She is getting old and stupid,” said the
sergeant indulgently, “and forgets things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Hello, here’s our young man,” as Eugene came
quietly into the room. “What have you been
doing, son?”</p>

<p>“I was reading,” said Eugene; “that is,”
he added hesitatingly, as he met Mrs. Hardy’s
scrutinizing glance, “I was looking beyond
my history lesson for to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Your first statement is true,” said Mrs.
Hardy quietly. “If you were only reading,
you were not studying. I don’t care to have
him learn lessons in the evening,” she said in
an explanatory tone to her husband, “because
it tires him.”</p>

<p>“No child should study in the evening,”
said the sergeant gruffly.</p>

<p>“I wished to find out what Washington did
when he became a man,” said Eugene.</p>

<p>“You like to read about the father of this
country, don’t you?” asked Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>“I do. I admire him. He was a great
man,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Greater than Napoleon?” inquired the sergeant
mischievously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy gently pushed his foot under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the table when she saw Eugene’s disturbed
face, but the sergeant would not recall his
question.</p>

<p>“No, no, not greater,” said the boy at length,
“not greater; I cannot forget my emperor;
but General Washington was better. He loved
more his fellow-men.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” said the sergeant; “you’ll make
a first-class citizen of the United States yet.”</p>

<p>“Never,” said Eugene abruptly.</p>

<p>The sergeant and his wife looked earnestly
at him.</p>

<p>“I shall be a Frenchman always,” said Eugene
vehemently. “I may never see my country
again; but I love her—I would die for
her;” and he grew deathly pale, as he always
did when he was much moved.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said the sergeant. “The
world wants more boys like you. Always
stand up for your own country, but be charitable
to others. France is a wide world, my
boy, but there’s a wider.”</p>

<p>“You mean America?”</p>

<p>“No; I mean the world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>“I like America,” said Eugene; “but I detest
England.”</p>

<p>“There’s where you’re wrong,” said the sergeant.
“If I hated England, I should feel
like a child hating my mother. They’re a
magnificent nation over there; though sometimes
they provoke us, and sometimes we provoke
them. However, they’ll stand more
goading from us than they will from any other
people on the face of the earth. Just you
make a note of that, my boy. You’ll find it’s
true some day, and then you will appreciate
them.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” said Eugene; “in the day that
tolerate the republic in France.”</p>

<p>“Queer little lad,” said the sergeant, affectionately
laying a hand on Eugene’s smooth
head. “You can’t look ahead and see yourself
a tolerant man?”</p>

<p>Eugene rarely let a question go unanswered.
He had been brought up to reply to every remark
addressed to him; but seeing he had some
difficulty in answering this, the sergeant went
on. “I can. You have a fair start toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
making a first-class,—what is it they call
those people that are at home among all nations,—oh,
yes, a cosmopolite. Wife, suppose
I go on with my reading?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” she replied, as the sergeant again
took up his book.</p>

<p>Eugene sat down at a little distance from
him, and listened attentively to a tale of far-away
Africa. Mrs. Hardy listened, too, for a
short time; then she laid down her work and
gazed attentively, first at the boy on the sofa,
and then at her husband beside her. Something
stirred softly in her heart as she looked
at these two beings,—her husband and her
adopted son. For them she felt that she could
endure any hardship, any privation. If the
occasion should arise, she felt that she could
even lay down her life for them.</p>

<p>“I used to think that I was happy, but I am
happier now,” she murmured. “My love for
my husband makes me love the boy more, and
my love for the boy makes me love my husband
more.”</p>

<p>Eugene, as if aware that her attention was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
concentrated on him, began to fidget in a sensitive
way, then he got up and moved to a chair
next her. She took his hand in hers, and the
boy leaned his head against her shoulder while
he again listened to the reading.</p>

<p>At last the sergeant put down the book.
“Wife,” he said, “it is half-past nine.”</p>

<p>“I will go to bed,” said Eugene, rising immediately.
“Good-night, Mrs. Hardy.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, my dear boy,” she said, “my
son.”</p>

<p>A curious look came over the boy’s face. He
colored, looked confused, and she thought that
his parted lips were forming the word “mother,”
when suddenly her two cats, who were usually
taken with a spirit of mischief about bedtime,
sprang at her workbasket, and by upsetting it
diverted her attention from Eugene.</p>

<p>He laughed in the merry way that he had
learned since coming to her house; and at once
he and the sergeant and the cats engaged in
a frolic, and by turns chased each other and
the spools of thread that went rolling all over
the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy stood looking at them with a
smile on her face when, in the midst of their
fun, they heard a ring at the door-bell.</p>

<p>Eugene jumped up. “Allow me to open the
door,” he said in his pretty, courteous way; and
Mrs. Hardy stood aside to let him pass.</p>

<p>The parlor door remained open; and to her
surprise she heard from the hall, first an eager
exclamation from Eugene, then a succession of
rapid French sentences.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” said the sergeant, turning
his red face toward her.</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine. Wait! Eugene is bringing
the person in.”</p>

<p>At that minute the boy appeared in the
doorway, ushering in a tall, very foreign-looking,
brown-faced man, clad in a black cassock.</p>

<p>The boy’s cheeks were blazing, and his eyes
were excited. “Mrs. Hardy,” he said in a
repressed voice, “permit me to present to
you monsieur le curé Déjoux of Châtillon-sur-Loir.
I have told him in the hall that it
is with you that I have found refuge. Enter,
monsieur.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>The sergeant flashed a quick glance at his
wife. How would she stand this? The priest
probably came to take her darling back to
France. To his relief she was perfectly calm,
though clearly surprised. She looked without
consternation into the grave, kindly, almost
childish face of the stranger.</p>

<p>The sergeant pressed forward, and shook
hands with his caller; then wondering that
his cassock should be so handsome, and his
boots so clumsy, and his bare, ungloved hands
so brown, he pointed to a chair, and begged
him to be seated.</p>

<p>The curé bowed once more in a paternal
manner, and sitting down, looked at Eugene,
who stood at his elbow with glittering eyes
that scarcely moved from his face.</p>

<p>“You are here, I take it, from the boy’s
grand-uncle,” said the sergeant, coming directly
to the object of his caller’s visit.</p>

<p>The priest did not understand a word of
what he said. He spread out his hands, then
turned to Eugene, who had at last ceased to
hover about him, and had dropped on a stool
by his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Monsieur understands English,” said the
boy, “if you will speak slowly. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>The priest smiled, and showed a good set
of white teeth. “Yes,” he said in a stumbling
voice. “Vairy, vairy slow.”</p>

<p>“You—have—come—for—Eugene, I
suppose,” said the sergeant spasmodically.</p>

<p>“I comprehand <i>parfaitement</i>,” returned the
priest. “It ees true, I come to seek heem.”</p>

<p>“It is getting late now,” said Mrs. Hardy
with a glance at the clock, “and Eugene will
be too much fatigued to sleep. Suppose we put
off our business conversation till the morning,
and talk of other things.”</p>

<p>The priest turned his gentle face toward
his hostess. He had not understood what she
said.</p>

<p>Eugene put her sentences into liquid French
for him; and he made a gesture of assent,
and said in laborious English, “Madame has
right.”</p>

<p>“Ah, no,” said Eugene; “I could not sleep.
With Mrs. Hardy’s permission, let us talk a
long, long time. Tell me of France, dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
monsieur le curé. Are you still in the little
village below the château?”</p>

<p>“Steel there, excep’ when I voyage in
Amérique,” said the priest in peaceful amusement.
“Nevair have I voyage before.”</p>

<p>“And my uncle received my letter?” said
Eugene.</p>

<p>“He deed,” said the priest seriously.</p>

<p>“And he showed it to you?”</p>

<p>“No, no; he deed not that.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you what I had written?”
asked Eugene.</p>

<p>“No, my chile.”</p>

<p>“He was angry, for example?”</p>

<p>“Well angry, leetle one. Thou deed write
wrong, ees it not?”</p>

<p>“Possibly I did,” said Eugene with a shrug
of his shoulders; and for the first time Mrs.
Hardy found her suspicion verified that the
boy had had some prickings of conscience
about the letter that he had written to his
grand-uncle.</p>

<p>“Thy onkel has many cheeldren,” said the
curé amiably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>“He has but a son and a daughter,” rejoined
Eugene hastily.</p>

<p>“But the cheeldren’s cheeldren,” said the
priest, expanding his hands. “Many they
are, like the birds of the feelds.”</p>

<p>“Therefore,” said Mrs. Hardy slowly, “he
cannot do much for Eugene. Is that what
you wish to say?”</p>

<p>“Pardon, madame,” said the curé.</p>

<p>Eugene explained what she meant, and the
priest assented by a profound bow.</p>

<p>“But he has sent me money,” said Eugene,
frowning slightly. “Much money, has he
not, monsieur le curé?”</p>

<p>The curé shook his head. “He has sent
me—not money. Monsieur thy onkel wishes,”
and he directed his remark to Mrs. Hardy,
“that thees dear boy return to hees country.”</p>

<p>“Pause a moment, monsieur le curé,” said
Eugene urgently, “and pardon me, Mrs.
Hardy, though it is not civil to speak a language
you do not understand, but I cannot
wait;” and then ensued a brief colloquy between
them in French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy’s face grew paler and paler, and
his manner quieter, as they proceeded, while
the curé became flushed and eloquent.</p>

<p>“Eugene is suffering, poor lad. I wonder
what the priest is saying,” murmured Mrs.
Hardy.</p>

<p>At last the conversation was over. The expression
of hope and animation that had illumined
the boy’s countenance when he greeted
the curé had all died away. He was composed
now, and almost sullen.</p>

<p>“All is over,” he said with a despairing
gesture; “my uncle renounces me.”</p>

<p>The curé, who was listening eagerly to him,
caught the word “renounce.”</p>

<p>“Eugene,” he interposed gravely, “thou deceivest
also thyself and thy friends. Willst
thou explain?”</p>

<p>Eugene turned to the Hardys, and said in a
dull voice, “My grand-uncle offers me a pittance
which I do not receive unless I go to
France—not to live with him,” bitterly, “ah,
no, but with monsieur the curé.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me from what I have heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
you say,” remarked the sergeant, “that you
would not care to take up your abode with
your uncle.”</p>

<p>“I would never live with him,” said Eugene
proudly; “yet he should offer to have
me inhabit the château which should be
mine.”</p>

<p>“Would you not like to live with this
gentleman?” asked Mrs. Hardy in a tense
voice.</p>

<p>Eugene turned his pain-stricken face toward
her. When the curé had first appeared, the
lad had immediately assumed a patronizing air
toward the two people who had been as adopted
parents to him. Now, however, his pride was
all gone. His grand expectations from his
uncle were not to be realized. He felt himself
to be a poor, despised boy.</p>

<p>“What does it matter whether I like it or
not,” he said with a bitter smile. “I am
obliged to go to France. I must live with this
good man, but I fear that I shall be a torment
to him. However, some day I shall revenge
myself on my uncle. I shall study it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>“Eugene,” said Mrs. Hardy suddenly, “you
must go to bed; you are not yourself.”</p>

<p>”You will spend the night with us, will
you not?” said the sergeant hospitably to
their visitor.</p>

<p>The priest said that it would be “too much
pleasure,” that he had “conveyed” his travelling-bag
to a near hotel, and that he was sorry
to have “deranged” them by coming so late,
but he had been detained by a search for Eugene
in his old quarters.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter,” said the sergeant;
“better late than never. I’ll go with you
and get your bag, and we can put you up
here.”</p>

<p>The priest overwhelmed him with thanks;
and while the sergeant went for his hat, he
looked about the pleasant room, and said appreciatively,
“Ah, but you are well <i>cossu</i>
here.”</p>

<p>“What does he mean?” asked Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>“It is like a bean in a soft pod,” said Eugene.
“One uses the word in France. This
house is indeed a palace compared with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
house of the poor curé,” he went on, after the
priest had uttered a cheerful <i>au revoir</i> and
had disappeared with the sergeant.</p>

<p>“What is his house like?” asked Mrs.
Hardy curiously.</p>

<p>“Châtillon-sur-Loir is a small village,” replied
Eugene. “There is a broad green in
the centre of it. On one side in a thatched
cottage lives the curé with old Jeanne his
servant. He has only a few pieces of furniture.
He drinks but little wine, mostly water
or mallow tea; and he eats black bread, for
the white is dear. He wears an old cotton
cassock; the one that he has on is probably a
gift from my grand-aunt, who is pious. And
he gives away everything, even the wood for
his stove. He goes from his cottage to the
chapel where he officiates; he visits the peasants
who are stupid. He saunters to and fro on
the green, reading his breviary or the <i>Figaro</i>.
Oh, it is a charming existence!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy suppressed a smile. “You would
be less unhappy with us,” she said.</p>

<p>Eugene looked at her quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not stay with us?” she murmured
caressingly. “You know that we love you,
and would consider you our child if you would
let us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no!” said Eugene, raising his hands
as if he were putting some temptation from
him. “Do not mention this, for it is among
the impossible things.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” she said abruptly; and she
kissed him tenderly, and then pushed him from
her. “Go, get into your little bed, but remember
this when you are fretting there,—that
there is always one heart open to you,
one home ready for you. Whether you go to
France or stay here I shall always look upon
you as my boy.”</p>

<p>Eugene paused. Then he seized her hand,
and pressed it warmly to his lips before he
rushed from the room. There were tears on
the hand when he dropped it, and Mrs. Hardy
sat looking at it steadfastly until her husband
came in.</p>

<p>“I just slipped the stranger into his room,
Bess,” he said. “I knew everything was ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
for him, and I thought I wouldn’t bother
bringing him in here again; for we folks who
have to get up early want to get to bed early.
What’s the matter? You’re not worrying, are
you?”</p>

<p>“No, Stephen; it seems to me I shall never
worry again.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a queer little woman,” he rejoined.
“You worry when I don’t expect it,
and when I do, you don’t.”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing to worry about in this
case,” she said.</p>

<p>“That’s odd. I thought you’d be struck all
of a heap. I nearly was when I took in the
situation.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that child is going back
to France?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. It looks like it. I’ve had a
great talk with the priest. When I get him
alone I can understand his lingo better. I got
out of him some information about the de Vargas.
He acknowledges that they’re a proud,
ugly-tempered kind of a family, and the young
ones in it are as upsetting and unmanageable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
as the old ones, which isn’t usual among French
children. The grand-uncle is furious with this
boy. He’ll not have an easy time in France.
The old man won’t have the boy live in the
château because he has the name of being unmanageable,
and he would talk his Bonapartism,
which isn’t fashionable in the neighborhood.
Bess, what is the difference between the old
<i>noblesse</i> and the new?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly. We’ll have to read
about France, Stephen.”</p>

<p>“The priest says that the de Vargas belong
to the new. He says if the boy was willing it
would be far better for him to remain in this
country, for he will be sure to get himself into
trouble in France; but he knows he won’t stay
here, so he is planning to take him back and
keep an eye on him. He says he’ll try to
squeeze money enough out of the grand-uncle
to send him away to school. What are you
smiling about?”</p>

<p>“Stephen,” said Mrs. Hardy gently but decidedly,
“that boy belongs to us. He will live
and die in this country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you crazy, Bess?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not. They may take him away,
but he’ll come back. I doubt if he even consents
to leave this city.”</p>

<p>The sergeant was surprised. “You are a
funny little woman,” he said shortly. “What
makes you say that?”</p>

<p>“Because he loves us,” she said triumphantly.
“I never was sure of it till this evening.
There’s no one that he likes in France.
He will stay where his heart is, or if he goes
away he will come back to us.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right and maybe you’re
wrong,” said the sergeant sagely. “Time will
tell; but I guess he’ll go to France and get
used to it.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="small">A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The sergeant was intensely amused and interested
in the French priest. He obtained a
few days’ leave from his duties, and occupied
himself in showing his guest the sights of an
American city. The innocence, the childishness,
and the curiosity of his companion, and,
above all, the attention that he attracted, provided
the sergeant with the most agreeable
sensation that he had had for many a day.</p>

<p>Eugene sometimes accompanied them, oftener
he did not. He was no longer cheerful and
contented, but had fallen into the reserved,
quiet, almost sullen state in which he had been
when Mrs. Hardy first knew him; and instead
of mingling freely with the little family, he
preferred to be left alone in his room, where
he sat musing by the hour.</p>

<p>Occasionally he roused himself as the claims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of hospitality asserted themselves in his mind,
and he politely endeavored to entertain the
priest by conversations about French matters.
To these conversations the sergeant lent a most
attentive ear. He had an immense curiosity on
the subject of foreign countries; and the precocious
remarks of Eugene with regard to the
peasant vote, the political clubs, and the rural
life of the nobility in France, with the almost
infantile responses of the curé to the boy’s
questions and unfathomable prejudices, formed
subjects on which he would remember to inform
himself after they were gone.</p>

<p>It had been definitely settled that Eugene
and the priest were to leave Boston at the end
of the week, and sail across the sea to France.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy rarely spoke of the boy’s departure;
but when she did, the reference was
made cheerfully, and as if she expected that
he would really go. In the meantime, when
she could spare a few hours from her household
duties, she busied herself with making preparations
for his journey by adding to his rather
scanty wardrobe. Eugene went shopping with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
her while the sergeant and the priest were engaged
in sight-seeing.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of the day preceding
the one on which they were to leave, Eugene
took the curé aside, and requested his companionship
while he made a call of importance.</p>

<p>“It is to see the father of the little Virgie,”
he said to Mrs. Hardy who was standing near.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I understand,” she said; “you
wish to say good-by to your small playmate.”</p>

<p>Eugene did not wish to say good-by to his
small playmate. However, he did not explain
this to Mrs. Hardy, but simply gave
her an inscrutable look from his deep black
eyes, and walked out of the room with the
priest.</p>

<p>It was a dark, chilly afternoon, and the
priest shivered slightly inside his black cassock
as they wended their way toward the
broad and fashionable avenue where Virgie’s
parents lived. He was not accustomed to such
piercing winds in sunny France; and he murmured
softly to himself, “<i>Le climat de Loir-et-Cher
est doux et tempéré</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Manning, Virgie’s father, quite unaware
of the visitors on their way to see him,
had just come home from his office, and sat
in his wife’s room talking to her, and waiting
for dinner to be announced, when a maid
knocked at the door, and said that a priest
and a boy wanted to see him. He glanced
sharply at her, and asked, “What are their
names?”</p>

<p>“I forget, sir,” she said hesitatingly. “They
were queer-sounding and foreign.”</p>

<p>“I cannot see them,” said Mr. Manning,
settling himself back comfortably in his chair.
“They are probably begging.”</p>

<p>The maid went down-stairs to a small reception-room,
and gave the strangers Mr.
Manning’s message.</p>

<p>“Return to your master, and say that I
request an interview with him on the subject
of business,” said Eugene firmly.</p>

<p>The maid felt the strange power that the
lad exerted on all those who came in contact
with him; and throwing him a glance of
veiled admiration, she again went up-stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell the boy that I talk business in my
office,” said Mr. Manning shortly. “Let him
go there in the morning.”</p>

<p>Eugene was not daunted by this message.
“Repeat carefully my words,” he said to the
amused maid; and his eyes flamed as he
looked at her. “To-morrow I shall be on my
way to France. I have now a last chance
to see the gentleman of this house. If he
refuses, he may regret his loss.”</p>

<p>The maid once more bent her footsteps
toward the staircase, and on the way met
Bridget, with whom she had a whispered colloquy.</p>

<p>“It’s the little French boy, sir, that plays
with Miss Virgie,” she said on returning to
Mr. Manning.</p>

<p>“Is it?” said the gentleman with a laugh.
“He is going to get on in the world, whoever
he is;” and he hurried down-stairs.</p>

<p>The priest and Eugene rose and bowed profoundly
at the entrance of the little, short,
sharp business man. His gray eyes took in
their peculiarities at one glance; then, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
flattered by their obeisances, he responded
by a nod of his head, and motioned
them to be seated.</p>

<p>“You know my small daughter?” he asked,
addressing Eugene.</p>

<p>“Sir, I have the honor of romping with
her at times,” said the boy solemnly.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” replied Mr. Manning with equal
solemnity; then with a quick, brisk movement
of his hand he brushed back the hair from his
forehead, and looked out of the window.</p>

<p>Eugene, overcome by the knowledge of the
importance of his mission, neither smiled nor
tried to make himself agreeable in any way
to this brusque man, but waited in sober patience
for a sufficient time to elapse before
the proper moment arrived to approach the
object of his visit.</p>

<p>“It is a raw day,” Mr. Manning said at
last, addressing the priest.</p>

<p>A raw day was something quite beyond
the curé’s ken; so he made no attempt to reply
to the remark, but bowed agreeably and
kept silence.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_166a.jpg" alt="Marriage Request" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="smcap small">“I am come,” said Eugene at last, “to demand the Hand of
                              Your Daughter in Marriage.”</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>”I hope that mademoiselle your daughter
is well,” said Eugene after a long pause.</p>

<p>“She is, thank you,” said Mr. Manning;
then he, too, relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>“I am come,” said Eugene at last, seeing
that the gentleman was politely yet stubbornly
resolved not to enter into conversation
with him, “supported by my friend monsieur
le curé of Châtillon-sur-Loir, to demand the
hand of mademoiselle your daughter in marriage.”</p>

<p>Mr. Manning was a man who had attained
to great self-possession; but at Eugene’s astonishing
request, he was again obliged to
stroke his hair vigorously, and once more look
out of the window.</p>

<p>Eugene contemplated him meanwhile in
great satisfaction. This composed man of business
would make an excellent father-in-law.</p>

<p>“May I ask,” said Mr. Manning at length,
abruptly bringing his attention once more to
bear upon his guest, “whether this is for immediate
or future marriage?”</p>

<p>“For the future,” said Eugene quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>“How old are you?” asked the gentleman.</p>

<p>“I am thirteen, but I will be fourteen on
my next birthday,” replied the lad.</p>

<p>“Well, now, don’t you think,” said Mr.
Manning in an almost coaxing tone of voice,
“that you are rather young yet to consider
so important a question as the choosing of
your future wife?”</p>

<p>“Exceedingly young,” said Eugene in an
equally reasonable voice. “I am taking a
part that is quite unusual, yet it suits me; for
I am leaving this country, perhaps not to return
for many years, therefore I beg you to
grant me your best attention.”</p>

<p>Mr. Manning stared at the curé, whom he
was almost forgetting in his interest in Eugene.
What kind of a man was this who,
after he had attained to years of maturity,
suffered a child to go about making himself
ridiculous?</p>

<p>The curé, blissfully unconscious of this
thought, and not understanding a word of
what he said or of what Eugene said, sat gazing
tranquilly out through the door of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
reception-room at the magnificence of two parlors
across the hall. He, a poor priest, had
never been in so handsome a house in his life.
The stone château of the de Vargas, which
was large, bare, and comfortless, could not be
compared with this mansion. As a young
man, he had gone from the cottage of his
peasant father and mother to a seminary, and
from thence to Paris for a few months, where
he lived the life of a student. He had seen
the exterior of fine hotels and palaces, but
never had his feet trodden such velvety carpets,
never had his limbs pressed such soft
furniture, never had he been received as a visitor
in the home of such a one as this small
amiable gentleman, who was probably a merchant
prince in this strange new country, and
who talked to his young friend with brevity,
and yet without the smallest tincture of
haughtiness.</p>

<p>The curé beamed amiably at Mr. Manning,
and not a suspicion of envy found lodgment
in his gentle breast. He was delighted to see
a man in possession of so much luxury. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
felicitate you, sir,” he murmured when Mr.
Manning briefly asked him what relation he
bore to Eugene.</p>

<p>“He cannot understand you, sir,” interposed
Eugene, “unless you speak French or slow
American.”</p>

<p>Mr. Manning made a gesture that significantly
commended the curé to the pleasant
company of his own thoughts. He was not
the man to talk “slow American” when a few
quick sentences would dispose of the business
in hand.</p>

<p>“So you wish me to seriously consider your
proposal, little boy,” he said, again confronting
Eugene.</p>

<p>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, give me your reasons for breaking
through the custom of this country, which
I suppose you know is not to arrange marriages
until the contracting parties are of age.”</p>

<p>“When they usually arrange them for themselves,”
continued Eugene.</p>

<p>Mr. Manning was excessively amused. “I
see you know all about it,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is my excuse for breaking through
your habits,” said Eugene earnestly. “I am
noble; you are not. You might desire to
have me for a son-in-law some day when I
am no longer here, for I go to France to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t I write you a letter?” asked Mr.
Manning.</p>

<p>“By the time of a few years I might form
other arrangements; therefore, while I am here,
where there are so few nobles, is it not better
to secure me for mademoiselle your daughter?”</p>

<p>“Suppose mademoiselle my daughter didn’t
wish to marry you when she grew up?”</p>

<p>“Oh! but she would,” said Eugene in great
surprise. “Well-bred ladies are always arranged
for in marriage in France, and they
enjoy it. It would not be necessary to inform
her until the time.”</p>

<p>“I know you fix these things in a different
way in France,” said Mr. Manning with extraordinary
seriousness; “but upon my word,
I don’t like to be the first to start the custom
here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am sure there would be no regret in the
case,” said Eugene warmly. “As little girls
are concerned, Mademoiselle Virgie is one of
the healthiest and the best-tempered. A suitable
dowry being attached to her, she will
have the benefit of my <i>beau nom</i>, as one says
in France. And will she not rejoice to be
madame la comtesse?”</p>

<p>“She will be too sensible a girl to hang her
happiness on a title, I hope,” said Mr. Manning;
“and though you seem a decent enough boy
now, you may grow up to be a scamp.”</p>

<p>Eugene’s little straight back grew more rigid
than before. “I am a de Vargas,” he said
with an expression of proud and conscious
superiority. “There are no scamps in our
family.”</p>

<p>Mr. Manning twisted his lips to conceal the
inward laughter that was consuming him.
“Granted that you are not going to be a
scamp, how will you earn your bread?”</p>

<p>“By my sword.”</p>

<p>“But there doesn’t seem to be much use for
swords nowadays. The sentiment of to-day is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
against war; and I would rather have a whole
son-in-law, not one that somebody is going to
carve to pieces.”</p>

<p>“But the army must be maintained. I shall
be an officer, and hold myself ready for war.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I see. Well, to come back to my starting-point,
I don’t like this plan. It’s too one-sided—too
sure for you, too risky for my
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Are not American girls equal to French
girls who do this?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I daresay; but I prefer an American
husband for my child. I know that French
people look out for money. You won’t let
your army officers marry without getting a certain
amount with a wife, I have heard; but
somehow or other the thing does not commend
itself to me. I don’t believe in marrying for
money.”</p>

<p>“But we do not do that,” exclaimed Eugene.
“Oh! you are rashly mistaken. A Frenchman
does not marry to obtain gold. It is to protect
his wife. Some money is necessary to be assured
to her; it is rarely enough to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
a carriage and a table. All women like the
arrangement—otherwise, why would mothers
marry their daughters if they themselves have
been unhappy?”</p>

<p>“I tell you what I’ll do,” said Mr. Manning
with prodigious gravity. “As I have told you,
I don’t like to be the first to launch this newfangled
thing in America. I believe I would
be mobbed if I started to go down town among
people who knew I had promised my baby girl
in marriage to a strange boy that I had only
seen once in my life; but you go round and
visit some of the other business men of this
city, and if you can get them to give their
consent to let this custom have a fair trial here,
I will sign a paper that will commit my daughter
to an engagement to you.”</p>

<p>Eugene’s face fell. “There will not be
time,” he said in a pained voice, “as we leave
to-morrow. I hoped that a writing could be
made out to-day.”</p>

<p>“I am not prepared to go that length,” said
Mr. Manning decidedly. “You see you have
sprung this thing on me. You will be coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
to America again—leave it till then, and we’ll
talk it over. Hello, boy, you’re not going to
faint, are you?”</p>

<p>Every vestige of color had left Eugene’s
face. He was not able to analyze his own feelings,
but deep down in his heart there was a
profound and blank regret that he was to leave
America. He had hoped that a definite agreement
could be made with the father of little
Virgie, which would give an excuse for a return
to the city where he had lately experienced the
only happy days of his life. If there was to
be no agreement, there could be no return.</p>

<p>“No, I never faint,” he said; and a sudden
reserve came over him. “I have only to apologize
for this intrusion and leave you. Monsieur
le curé, may I request you to go?”</p>

<p>“Sit down, boy, sit down,” said his host
kindly. “I want to ask you some questions
about yourself.”</p>

<p>Eugene resumed his seat, and with the air
of a complaisant though suffering martyr responded
to the questions put to him.</p>

<p>Something about his coldly courteous answers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
excited the keenest interest in his interrogator.
“See here, my lad,” he said at last,
“I want you to stay to dinner this evening and
meet my wife. Don’t say a word to her on the
subject of our conversation. I wish that to be
a secret between you and me; for to tell the
truth, you would only be laughed at if it were
to get out. Will you stay? and you, sir?” and
he addressed the curé.</p>

<p>Eugene at first recoiled in spirit from this
proposal, but he felt himself bound to convey
the invitation to the curé; and the delight of
the good man at the honor was so extravagant
and unbounded that the boy gracefully
yielded and consented to stay, only stipulating
that a message be sent to the Hardys,
who were expecting them to return to partake
of their supper.</p>

<p>“I will send my man up,” said Mr. Manning.
“Will you excuse me while I give
him the message, and notify my wife that you
are here?”</p>

<p>Eugene sat stiffly in his seat. He looked
neither to the right nor to the left, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
made only monosyllabic replies to the admiring
sentences rippling from the mouth of the
curé.</p>

<p>When Mr. Manning re-entered the room
escorting his wife, Eugene’s face brightened
somewhat. With a grace and a composure
that charmed the lady, he rose and stood
aside, while monsieur le curé almost prostrated
himself before her. Then he, too, made an inflexion
of his slender, supple body, and gazed
from under his black, drooping eyelashes at
the pretty mother of his desired <i>fiancée</i>.</p>

<p>He had never seen her before, and she had
never seen him. “Virgie talks a great deal
about you,” she said. “Thank you, no, I will
not take a chair. Dinner is just about to be
announced. Why, you are ever so much older
than Virgie. I thought you were quite a
young boy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Manning laughed quietly to himself.
He was apparently carrying on communications
with the curé in dumb show, but in reality
he was listening to his wife’s conversation
with Eugene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>“I do not feel young,” said Eugene soberly,
walking beside the lady out to the
brilliant splendor of the dining-room; “at
times it seems to me that I have lived my
whole life.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Manning was a plump, phlegmatic
woman, and by no means sensitive; yet at
the boy’s involuntary expression of inward
suffering and mental experiences beyond his
years, a sympathetic thrill passed over her,
and with an expression of pity, she showed
him his place at the table.</p>

<p>Eugene caught this expression, and in deep
irritation lowered his eyes to his plate. “Why
is it,” he reflected bitterly, “that since I
came among these Americans I catch their
candid ways—I reveal everything? I even
think in their language. I will begin to reform
at once, now that I am to return to my
own country;” and a reform he immediately
began according to his own standard. It was
easier for him to be composed and reserved
at this table than at the Hardys. He sat up
very straight in his chair, and in an adroit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
and delicate manner parried Mrs. Manning’s
rather curious questions about his mode of
life since his grandfather’s death.</p>

<p>Rather to her own surprise, as their conversation
progressed, Mrs. Manning found that
she was telling the boy far more about herself
than he was telling her about himself.
For one thing, she confessed to him her longing
to go to Europe; and Eugene said, “It is
our misfortune that you have not yet visited
us. May we not look forward to the pleasure
of soon seeing you in France?”</p>

<p>“I want to go to Europe next summer and
take Virgie,” she said.</p>

<p>“May I express the wish that you will honor
Châtillon-sur-Loir with a visit?”</p>

<p>“I should like to see something of real
French life ever so much,” said Mrs. Manning;
“and Virgie would be delighted to look you
up.”</p>

<p>“Then we shall live in the hope of seeing
you,” said Eugene sweetly, and with a side
glance at the curé, who, in blissful unconsciousness
of the fact that visitors were being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
invited under his humble roof, was taking his
soup with some noise, and in a state of utter
beatification.</p>

<p>As course after course was served, Eugene,
who six months before would have been enchanted
by the display of riches about him,
became more and more unhappy. He preserved
his composure, but it was at the expense
of his nerves. Mrs. Manning’s voice often
sounded distant and hollow in his ears; and
once or twice he roused himself with a start, to
find that a servant stood at his elbow vainly
striving to attract his attention.</p>

<p>What was the matter with him? He was
surrounded with things in which he took delight;
and in this fine house with these rich
people he should feel perfectly at home, yet
his dull and inappreciative eye wandered carelessly
over the costly dinner-service and the
display of exquisite flowers. The servants
moving noiselessly about wearied him; and the
lights, soft as they were, made his eyes smart
with unshed tears; while Mrs. Manning’s satin
dress, dainty as it was, had less beauty in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
sight than the plain white cotton gown of the
sergeant’s wife.</p>

<p>She was thinking about him now, that kind
woman in the cottage by the Fens. Probably
she was just drawing her chair up to the fire
in the cosey parlor, and was taking from her
workbasket one of the fine new garments that
she was making for him.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was murmuring softly to her
husband, “How I miss that boy!”</p>

<p>“What will she do when I am gone?” thought
Eugene in sudden terror. Something seemed
to gripe his heart, and he could have cried out
in his distress; yet he controlled himself, and
replied in a quiet, clear voice to a question
that Mrs. Manning was asking him.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam, I will thank you for some
preserved ginger. I am fond of it, and it is
some time since I have eaten of it.”</p>

<p>The curé ate long and with an admirable
appetite, and shortly after dinner showed an
amiable inclination to retire into a corner of
one of the parlors where a few luxurious armchairs
stood in inviting solitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>“Suppose I were to try one of these <i>fauteuils</i>,”
he said in a jocular way to Eugene;
and dropping into one, he buried his face in a
newspaper which Mr. Manning handed him,
and over whose pages, which were almost
wholly unintelligible to him, he was soon dozing
gently.</p>

<p>Mr. Manning politely ignored his presence;
and, being chiefly interested in Eugene, he,
quite unintentionally, kept the lad on the rack
for some time by asking him further questions
about himself and his plans for the future.</p>

<p>The boy could not evade his sharp businesslike
inquiries as he had done those of his
wife. He endured them with the best grace
possible, only growing a little white in the
effort to control himself. As soon as Mrs.
Manning’s return from the nursery, where she
had been to see her child, gave Eugene an
excuse for leaving, he rose gracefully, and
looked toward the curé.</p>

<p>“What, going already?” said Mr. Manning.
“Mamma, can’t this boy say good-by to your
little daughter? He thinks a great deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
her;” and his eyes gleamed mischievously as
they rested on Eugene.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Mrs. Manning. “As a
general thing I don’t like her to be disturbed
after she goes to bed, but we will make an
exception in favor of her playfellow.”</p>

<p>“Come along, then,” said Mr. Manning; and
he ran up-stairs more nimbly than Eugene,
and waited for him at the top of the staircase.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” he said briskly; and he
opened the door of a dimly lighted room.
“Are you asleep, pet?”</p>

<p>“No, papa,” said Virgie sleepily; and Eugene
saw her pretty head rising from a crib.</p>

<p>“Where is nurse?” asked Mr. Manning, advancing
to the crib.</p>

<p>“Gone down-stairs, cross old thing,” said
Virgie. “Have you brought your little girl
a present, papa?”</p>

<p>“No,” said her father with a laugh. “I
have brought a boy that wants to say good-by
to you. He is going away. Do you know
who it is?”</p>

<p>“’Course I do,” said Virgie, who was clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
in a bad temper; “it’s that cross boy Eugene.
Is he going to his old remperor?”</p>

<p>Eugene felt as if he were suffocating. He
had always fancied that he did not like this
little American girl, that he only endured
her; and he had considered it a great condescension
on his part that he should include her
in the childish stroke of diplomacy by which
he proposed to make the way clear for a return
to America. Now he saw that he had
been mistaken. He loved the small child
next to Mrs. Hardy and the sergeant, and her
indifference cut him to the heart.</p>

<p>“Little one,” he said resentfully, as he
stepped nearer, “you may never see me again.”</p>

<p>“Then Virgie will be glad,” said the child,
pouting out her lips at him; “once you
sweeped the ground with me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Manning was convulsed with amusement
at the calmly vindictive attitude of his
youthful daughter, and waited attentively for
Eugene’s next sentence.</p>

<p>“Shall I send you a present from France?”
he asked at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; Virgie hates French dolls.”</p>

<p>“Across the sea,” said Eugene mournfully,
“I shall soon forget you; for I shall have
boys to play with and you are but a girl.”</p>

<p>“When you go ’way, Eugene,” replied Virgie
in a cool and impassive manner, “I’ll frow
all the stones in the park at the remperor.”</p>

<p>This shaft did not excite his anger as she
thought it would; so she continued, cautiously
feeling her way, for she was afraid of him
when he lost his temper. “An’ maybe I’ll kill
the king, an’ the other pussies, an’ the mister
policeman, an’ maybe I’ll come an’ kill you.”</p>

<p>Her sweet and silly defiance did not provoke
the boy, and she lashed her childish
imagination for another taunt. “If Virgie
had a gun,” she murmured, “a big, big gun, I
guess she’d shoot you now.”</p>

<p>Eugene smiled sadly, and yet his eyes were
full of tears. Was he going to cry before this
child and the man who was silently regarding
him? The thought filled him with dismay;
and he turned on his heel, and abruptly went
toward the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” squealed Virgie dismally, “the
pretty buttons! come back, I want to see
them!”</p>

<p>Her volatile, childish fancy had been taken
with the glitter of some new buttons on
Eugene’s coat; and hastily wiping his eyes, he
returned to her, and before Mr. Manning could
prevent him, he had gallantly twisted a button
from its place, and put it in the child’s
hand.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Eugene, just dreffully,” she
said in delight; and she sprang up in her crib,
clasping her new treasure firmly in one hand,
while she extended the other toward him.
“Good-by, Virgie won’t hurt the remperor;
here’s a present for you;” and she caught up
a legless, armless doll lying on her dainty
pillow.</p>

<p>Eugene went to her, and she stuffed it in
his pocket. Then she yawned sleepily, put her
pink lips to his ear, and murmured, “Good-by,
Eugene, be a good girl;” and dropping down
on her pillow was asleep before they had
fairly left the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten minutes later Eugene and the priest
were walking quietly up the avenue in the
direction of the Hardys’ house, and Mr. Manning
and his wife sat talking together with
amused faces.</p>

<p>“What do you make of that boy?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t make much of him,” she replied.
“He seems a polite little cynic.”</p>

<p>“He is more than that,” said Mr. Manning
sagely. “If he were going to stay in this
country, I would do something for him.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="small">THAT WOMAN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Hardy was afraid that Eugene was
going to be ill. Several times while giving
her an account of his visit to the Mannings
he relapsed into long, troubled silences.</p>

<p>As soon as he had finished his recital she
sent him to bed, and shortly afterwards she
came and stood over him with a medicine bottle
in her hand.</p>

<p>He asked no questions; and after quickly
taking what she gave him, he kissed her hand,
and closing his eyes, fell into a troubled sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning he seemed more cheerful, but
he still acted like a boy in a dream; and the
sergeant muttered, “That lad doesn’t hear more
than half of what is said to him. He’s in a
dead worry about this business of going away.
Now I must have a few last words with the
priest. Come out into the garden, mussoo, it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
a fine morning;” and he took his guest out-of-doors.</p>

<p>“Now, look here, sir,” he said firmly, and he
seized a button on the priest’s cassock, “this
is your last day in Boston; and I want to tell
you before you take that boy to France, that
you’re to consider yourself as free as air to send
him back at any time it suits you and him, for
I guess his grand-uncle isn’t going to interfere
much with him.”</p>

<p>The curé hardly understood a word of what
the sergeant said, and the worthy man did not
expect that he would. The sergeant had formulated
a system about conversing with the
curé. The first time he uttered sentences he
rattled them off in any way just to accustom
the foreigner to the sound of the words. The
next time he repeated them slowly, the third
time more slowly, and with a liberal illustration
of gestures in order to make his meaning
entirely plain.</p>

<p>Therefore, when the curé had heard a trio of
these sentences, accompanied by a far-away
fling of his host’s hand to denote France, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
nearer one for Boston, and a comprehensive
sweep through the air to indicate freedom of
action, he understood perfectly, and nodded his
acquiescence and approval of the plan.</p>

<p>“But I think he weel not return,” he said.</p>

<p>“You don’t know anything about it,” said
the sergeant. “He is a queer lad; and like
most young fellows, and some old ones, he does
what you don’t think he will do, and what you
think he will do, he won’t.”</p>

<p>“Pardon,” said the curé.</p>

<p>“I can’t make you see that,” said the sergeant
decidedly, “because there isn’t any scope for
gestures, so we’ll let it pass. Now, I want to
tell you that I have a nest-egg, and my wife
has expectations, or rather a surety from a rich
aunt, so the boy wouldn’t suffer if he came
back. We could educate him like a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Eggs,” exclaimed the curé in delight as a
familiar word broke upon his ear in the first
utterance of a sentence. “Hens lay eggs.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the sergeant, “hens and eggs go
together; but good gracious, you’ve got me off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the track, and if I go to explain my meaning
to you, you’ll get all tangled up in a chicken-coop.
Forget it, mussoo.”</p>

<p>“Forget eggs; no, I remembare,” said the
curé reproachfully.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll have to dispose of that,” said
the sergeant desperately. “What did I want
to use the old expression for? Hens are useful
creatures;” and to expedite matters he began to
flap his arms and cluck, and then brought his
hands near the ground to measure off the dimensions
of a hen of respectable appearance.</p>

<p>“Eggs are good for eating,” said the curé
amiably.</p>

<p>“Yes, fine,” said the sergeant; and he drew
a handful of silver from his pocket. “Do
you see that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p>“Money—good stuff to have—well, I’ve
a lot of it—heaps;” and he began to build
an airy pyramid on the ground. “Savings,
you know, and a little I had left me by my
parents—enough to educate a boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I comprehend,” said the curé, delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
beyond measure at his own keenness;
“you sell eggs, you make money. One does
it in France. One sells all things.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the sergeant philosophically.
“Have me sell eggs or anything you
like, the money is there, anyway, and the boy
is welcome to it. Hello, here he is. Come
here, lad, and dash this off to your protector.
You are now in America, you start for France
in a few hours; you may stay there six weeks,
or six months, or six years, or all your life;
but unless you hear from us that we have
forgotten you or changed our minds, you’re
at liberty to come here and live with us at
any time. Do you understand that?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said Eugene; “and I thank you.”</p>

<p>While he was talking to the curé, the sergeant
sighed heavily, and went sauntering
down the walk to the gate, and out through
it to the park. He was not as sanguine as
his wife about Eugene’s reluctance to leave
them, and he could not bear to remain at
home on this the last day of his stay with
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>When he returned for dinner in the middle
of the day he exerted himself to be cheerful;
but he disappeared immediately afterward, and
did not come back until late in the afternoon,
in time to take Eugene and the priest to the
train.</p>

<p>All day long Eugene had followed Mrs.
Hardy about the house, waiting on her in a
quiet and unobtrusive way, but saying very
little. He did not understand her; but she
understood him perfectly, and she saw that
as yet there was no flagging in his resolve to
go to France.</p>

<p>He wondered that this woman, who professed
to love him so much and who cried so
easily, had not yet, as far as he had known,
shed a tear over his departure. She did not
even break down when they reached the station,
and saw before them the long line of
cars on which he was to be whirled away
from her.</p>

<p>Eugene shuddered at the sight, and clung
convulsively to her hand. “Do you feel that
you ought not to go?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no,” said the boy in a tortured voice.
“I only feel it horrible to go; yet it is for
the best, and it is duty. I shall come back
some day.”</p>

<p>“Wife,” said the sergeant inexorably, “it
is time for them to get on board the train.
Good-by, son.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said Eugene, shaking hands with
him; “you have been good to me. I thank
you”—and here his voice failed him, and he
groped blindly for Mrs. Hardy.</p>

<p>When he felt her arms around him, he
whispered three words in her ear—the words
she had longed to hear, and that he had never
given her until now.</p>

<p>“I love you,” he breathed with his eager
lips against her cheek; and then he added
with a heartbroken sigh, “if I were not a
beggar I should have stayed with you; but
I am proud”—here he broke off, and without
looking at her again, rushed into the
car and took his seat.</p>

<p>The curé followed him slowly and cautiously,
put in one of his capacious pockets the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
checks and tickets that the sergeant handed
to him; then the conductor shouted, the crowd
of people stepped back, and the train moved
off.</p>

<p>Eugene remained motionless and silent in
his corner of the seat. He did not speak until
they reached the Fall River station, and
there he contented himself with monosyllabic
replies to the curé’s remarks.</p>

<p>Upon arriving on the steamer the curé
sauntered wonderingly about, taking in the
details of the life on board this floating palace.
He would want to describe it accurately
upon reaching home, for he knew that the
peasants of Châtillon-sur-Loir were capable of
taking in accounts of greater wonders than
these.</p>

<p>Eugene had gone immediately to bed. After
an hour or two the curé followed him. Before
turning into his berth for the night, he
looked at the one above him. The boy lay
with his arm over his face. Probably he had
been asleep for some time.</p>

<p>Being tired, and having a mind at peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
with himself and the world, the priest slept
soundly and happily until shortly after daybreak.
Then he got up; and after gazing through
his small window at the red ball of
the sun, he raised his eyes to the upper berth
where he supposed Eugene was still sleeping.</p>

<p>To his surprise and distress the lad was
crouched in a corner, his limbs convulsed, his
face rigid, and his hands tightly clasped in
the bedclothes.</p>

<p>“How now, little one—art thou having a
fit?” exclaimed the priest in his own language.
“Let me dash some water in thy
face. Oh, this is pitiful!”</p>

<p>Eugene stretched out his hand in a forbidding
way, but did not reply to him.</p>

<p>“Thou art having a spasm,” said the priest.
“I am sure of it. Let me seek a doctor.
Oh! what is the matter with thee?”</p>

<p>“It is that woman,” gasped Eugene. “Oh!
I cannot endure it.”</p>

<p>“A woman!” repeated the priest, inspecting
the narrow dimensions of their room in great
amazement; “there is no woman here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is that woman yonder, monsieur le
curé,” said Eugene respectfully, and yet with
restrained anger; “there is but one woman
that I consider—the one who has been so
peerless for me. Oh! I wish to see her. I
wish to see her;” and he flung himself about
his berth in a paroxysm of regret and passion.</p>

<p>“Poor little one,” said the priest, “hast thou
been suffering all through the long night?”</p>

<p>“I have not slept,” said Eugene miserably.
“I have sat up and thought of many things.
I wish to go back. I cannot endure this.”</p>

<p>“I will be a mother to thee,” said the
priest soothingly; “and thou canst write to
that good woman.”</p>

<p>“She will not care for letters,” exclaimed
Eugene. “She wishes me, and I wish her.
When I lie down at night she wishes me happy
dreams. I did not know that I cared for it
until last night when she was not here. I
must go back to her. I <i>shall</i> go back;” and
he surveyed his companion in open defiance.</p>

<p>The priest was puzzled. “Dost thou desire
to remain always in this country?” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” Eugene returned with sudden coolness.
“If that woman should die, possibly I
might return to France. While she lives I
will stay with her.”</p>

<p>“Thou art an obstinate child,” muttered the
curé to himself, “and I believe thee. Neither
the church nor the world restrains the de
Vargas. They are unruly, like the wild boars.”
Then he said aloud,—“What dost thou propose
to do?”</p>

<p>“To return now,” cried Eugene, flinging up
his head, “now, monsieur le curé. With your
permission I will go back—I will say to her
I am sorry for the disturbances I have made
you. In future I shall try to be more peaceful.”</p>

<p>“My life will be less lively without thee,”
observed the curé thoughtfully; “and were I
alone concerned thou wouldst freely have my
consent to remain, but thy grand-uncle”—</p>

<p>“Tell him,” said Eugene with bent brows
and flashing eyes, “tell him that he has no
authority over me. That I refuse the meagre
sum that he would dole out to me. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
country I will learn how to support myself;
yet also tell him that since I love that woman
I hate him less.”</p>

<p>“Thou art a fiery lad,” murmured the curé
with resignation. “If thy grand-uncle were
a de Vargas I would need to soften that message.”</p>

<p>“Have I your permission to return?” asked
Eugene urgently.</p>

<p>“Thou hast. Of what use would it be to
withhold it?” said the curé frankly.</p>

<p>“Of no use,” replied the boy with a relieved
gesture; “for this morning I find myself capable
of running away. As soon as we arrive
in New York I will leave you;” and a bright
smile stole over his face.</p>

<p>The curé seized his black hat, and went for
a stroll on the deck, where he was a few
minutes later joined by a new Eugene,—a
happy, contented boy, who seized his hand, and
begged forgiveness for the determined manner
in which he had just addressed him.</p>

<p>“Droll little lad,” said the priest, “I wonder
what thy life will be? I say to thee as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
that good man said yesterday, thou hast a
friend in me away in France. My cottage
door will always be open to thee.”</p>

<p>Eugene pressed one of the curé’s hands in
both of his, while tears stood in his eyes. Then
they went below to have breakfast; and while
the boy was eating and drinking in a dainty,
half-famished way, the curé cast frequent and
curious glances at him. A transformation had
certainly been effected in the lad. He was no
longer buried in unhappy reserve. His face
was glowing; and he looked often and fearlessly
at his companion, and smiled, as if some
of the affection that he felt for his adopted
mother was shed upon every one that had
come within the circle of her influence.</p>

<p>When they steamed into New York Harbor,
the curé gazed about him in wonder and admiration.
Eugene, plunged in a delicious
revery, took no notice of the lofty buildings,
the crowded wharves, and the maze of shipping,
but stood close to the curé, and stared
directly in front of him in intense abstraction
of mind.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_200a.jpg" alt="Blessing" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="smcap small">The Curé slowly pronounced a Blessing.</span>
  </div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>After they landed, they had several hours of
tiresome quest,—first in search of the steamer
that was to take the curé to Havre, then to find
a railway station from which Eugene could
be sent back to Boston. The dreamy boy and
the foreign man were directed and informed,
and redirected and reinformed; and some hours
elapsed before the curé had deposited his bag
on the steamer, and had finally and repeatedly
been assured that the trains from the station in
which he was then standing certainly did run
to Boston, and certainly would carry the boy
there as speedily as steam could take him.</p>

<p>“Go in, little one—into the carriage and
take thy seat,” said the curé in an agony of
excitement. “Oh! never did I see such a place
as this city. My head spins; it is worse than
Paris!”</p>

<p>“I will go in,” said Eugene; “but first your
blessing, monsieur le curé; for I no longer
hate the priesthood, and say if you will that
you do not blame me.”</p>

<p>The curé suddenly became calm. An angelic
smile overspread his face; and as Eugene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
drew his cap from his head, the man laid his
hands on his smooth dark hair, and slowly
pronounced a blessing.</p>

<p>“<i>Au nom de Dieu</i>,” Eugene murmured after
him; then he flung himself in the curé’s arms,
and embraced him heartily.</p>

<p>“We shall meet again, little one,” said the
curé, “we shall meet again;” and the last object
that the boy’s eyes rested on as his train pulled
slowly out of the station was the tall black
figure of the priest standing a little back from
the crowd, his black hat in his hand, his finger
pointing solemnly upward from the noise and
babel of the city.</p>

<p>Eugene sat very quiet and still in his seat.
His heart was sore at the parting from the curé,
which was like the snapping of the last link
that bound him to his native land; and yet
it was singing like a bird at the prospect of
his speedy reunion with his foster-parents. He
closed his happy eyes; and in a very few
minutes he had fallen sound asleep, with a
smile on his face that made every passer-by
look at him in amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>The curé knew that Eugene, who had at
different times in his life spent many months
in Paris, would be quite able to look out for
himself on reaching the city that had been his
home for so many months. He would have
been more convinced of this had he seen the
adroit way in which the boy slipped between
the throng of people when he reached Boston.
He took a short cut to the street corner where
he would find a car, and in a very short time
his eye singled out the desired one from a number
that were approaching. He sprang on it,
and was borne swiftly away from the streets
toward the large park which had become the
dearest spot on earth to him.</p>

<p>Soon he saw against the western sky the
tall straight poplars of the Boylston-street entrance;
and springing from the car as it stopped
on a corner, he ran, for he was too much agitated
to walk, in the direction of the cottage.</p>

<p>“Ah, that woman, that woman,” he kept repeating
to himself; “but she will be glad to
see me.”</p>

<p>Though it was quite dark, there were no
lights in the windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>“She is absent,” he said; “but I will not
grieve, for she will return.”</p>

<p>He hurried up the garden-path, and tried to
turn the handle of the front door. “Ah, it is
locked—the back one also, I suppose;” and
he trotted cheerfully to the rear of the house.</p>

<p>“They are away,” he said, when he found
he could not gain entrance there; “and some
boys would be afraid. I shall not be;” and he
lifted his face up proudly to the overcast sky,
“not even if they stay all night. I will look
into my charming room;” and he shaded his
eyes with his hands, and peered into one of
the back rooms on the ground floor. Then
he tried to raise the window with his hand.
“Why, it is open,” he said delightedly; “I
can get in. Why did that woman leave open
this window?”</p>

<p>Eugene crawled in, and walked through the
house seeking matches, and lighting the gas
everywhere he went to make the rooms cheerful
for the return of the sergeant and his
wife. However, they did not appear, though
seven o’clock came, then eight, and finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
nine. Only the two cats came home, springing
in through the open window, and greeting
him with demure expressions of pleasure.</p>

<p>The boy fed and caressed them; and then,
followed by the pair who were in a state of
silent satisfaction, he sat down by his window,
and resting his elbows on the window-sill,
looked out across the garden into the street.
It was very quiet. The Hardys had no near
neighbors, and only at rare intervals did anyone
pass, yet Eugene was not afraid.</p>

<p>“I am happy—happy,” he murmured, pressing
his face against the tortoiseshell fur of one
of the cats. “I cannot be lonely unless she
stays a long, long time. Probably they are to
remain all night. It must be a visit to the
aunt. Come in, pussy. I must close the window,
for it is cold.”</p>

<p>The cat, however, did not wish him to close
it. With symptoms of great excitement she
rubbed herself back and forth against his
arms, and acted as if she were trying to attract
his attention to the other cat, who had
sprung boldly out on one of the flower-beds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>Eugene placed one hand on the window-sill,
and jumped out after her. “What is the
matter, Dodo?” he said.</p>

<p>The night was very dark, and it had begun
to rain. The electric light, however, shone
on this part of the garden, and he could see a
small dark creature moving slowly along the
fence.</p>

<p>“That must be one of the park cats,” said
Eugene—“not the king, for there is no white
on it. Why, it is his chum. What are you
doing here, Squirrel, and why do you move so
slowly?”</p>

<p>With a sharp almost human cry of pain, the
little dark animal dropped from the fence to
the ground.</p>

<p>“What is wrong with you?” said Eugene
as he walked along beside him.</p>

<p>The cat paused an instant to give him a
look of recognition, then, with a piteous mew,
continued his journey to the house. On reaching
Eugene’s window the animal lifted his
head beseechingly.</p>

<p>“Thou wishest to go in, small park cat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>”
said Eugene, dropping into French; “well,
spring for it. I permit thee, though it is late
for a call.”</p>

<p>The cat gathered his limbs together, and,
with something between a mew of gratitude
and a wail of pain, managed to attain to the
window-ledge.</p>

<p>“Why, thou art bleeding,” said Eugene in
dismay, as he noticed red drops on the light
wood. “Unfortunate animal, have the dogs
been at thee?” and he hurried in after the
cat, and bent over him as he lay on the floor
exhausted by his journey to the house.</p>

<p>The cat did not resent the touch of his
gentle fingers; and Eugene soon discovered
the extent of his injuries, and made a bandage
to hold together the torn skin. Immediately,
however, on being released, Squirrel signified
his wish to leave the room. Eugene opened
the door, and followed him out through the
hall to Mrs. Hardy’s room.</p>

<p>“Is not this devotion!” exclaimed the boy,
throwing out his hands with a gesture of admiration.
“Sick and wounded, and apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
about to die, the faithful creature would
be in the home of his mistress. Poor pussy,
I compassionate thee;” and slipping off his
jacket the boy laid it on the bed, and lifted
the cat on it.</p>

<p>“Thy mistress is away. I do not know
when she will return,” he said, leaning over
the suffering creature, and speaking in exquisitely
soft and sympathetic tones; “but if
she were here she would stroke thy mangled
fur, and say kindly, ‘Courage, little cat, thy
sufferings will soon be over;’ and for her sake
I put my hand on thy head, and I will sit by
thee till thou art no more. Perhaps, though,
thou wouldst like some milk;” and he ran
quickly to the kitchen, and brought back some
cream in a saucer.</p>

<p>The dying cat refused to take it; so the
boy smeared some on his lips, and then continued
his compassionate sentences. Occasionally,
in response to his remarks to the effect
that death overtakes all, that there is but one
lot for king, pauper, or dumb beast, the animal
would return a plaintive mew. At last the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
unfortunate Squirrel’s sufferings were over.
He gave one gasp, like a dying child, then
lay quite still.</p>

<p>“I cannot cry, little cat,” said Eugene
softly, wrapping the coat around him, and
tiptoeing his way back to his room; “but I,
nevertheless, grieve for thee. Now what is
to be done? That dear woman evidently does
not return to-night;” and he shivered, and
glanced over his shoulder. “I am not afraid,
and yet the house is desolate.”</p>

<p>For some time he stood with his head on
his breast, then he raised it with a sudden
air of decision. “I will go to see the king.
He, too, will be sorrowing on account of the
absence of his friend.”</p>

<p>He buttoned round him a warm overcoat,
put out the light in his room, and shut in it
the two old cats who had been mewing dismally
about him ever since their suffering
comrade had arrived. Then, carrying the
body of the unlucky Squirrel in his arms, he
wended his way to the park.</p>

<p>King Boozy was watching, and not sleeping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
All through the evening he had been
wandering to and fro under the trees, awaiting
the arrival of the absent Squirrel before
he could go to sleep. On account of the
darkness and rain of the night not many persons
passed through the park; and of those
who took the walk under the poplars not one
suspected the eager scrutiny of the pair of
eyes belonging to the little animal crouching
beneath the leaves—not one but Eugene.
He knew that the cat was there, and whistled
softly to him.</p>

<p>The king was at his side in an instant,
and there was no need for Eugene to tell him
what had happened. He knew at once, and
in dumb sorrow trotted beside the boy to his
home in the underbrush.</p>

<p>“There he is, Boozy,” said Eugene, laying
the cat carefully on the ground, and spreading
open the coat. “I thought it better for
thee to know. Thou wilt not cry? No, that
is a good, sensible cat.”</p>

<p>The king crept close to his dead friend, and
examined him closely and affectionately, pausing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
every few minutes to look up at Eugene
as if to say, “Will he not revive?”</p>

<p>The boy bent over him in the darkness.
“No, Boozy,” he said, “thou canst not bring
him back. Poor little cat, he has lived his
day, and dogs or cruel boys have killed him.
And now I must return to the house, for it is
chilly here, but first I must tell thee something;”
and he caught the creature to him in
a tumult of affection. “Listen, till I tell thee
that I have been away, and that I have come
back a new boy. I do not know what has
caused the change in me; but my heart feels
no longer hard and cold, but soft, quite soft,
like thy fur. I do not believe all that these
grown people tell me; but I believe many
things, and I think that having lived longer
they may know a little more than I do. I
must be patient and learn; and that woman,
that woman—I love her, and she shall be my
mother! Ah, Boozy,” and the boy sprang to
his feet, and lifted his cap reverently from his
head, “I shall be a son to her. I shall stay
in this new, free country as long as she lives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
She says that I must not hate England, and I
will not hate it. She says that I must endure
the republic in France, and I will do that.
If she will guide me I will follow her, now
that I know that women are good and do not
deceive. My beloved grandfather did not understand.
He did not know the sergeant’s
wife. <i>Au revoir</i>, little cat: I must go back to
the house lest she possibly arrive and find me
absent. Wilt thou come with me?”</p>

<p>No, the cat did not wish to accompany him.
Upon being released from Eugene’s arms he
crept to the coat, and the last glimpse that
the boy had of him as he reluctantly went
away was of the king sitting in dignified sorrow
beside the body of his friend.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="small">THE RETURN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>On the evening that Eugene left Boston,
Mrs. Hardy had received a telegram announcing
the serious illness of her aunt; and accompanied
by her husband she had at once left
her home to go and see her. They were away
a day and two nights, and early on the morning
of the next day they returned home.</p>

<p>They were a very quiet couple as they drew
near the cottage. “It seems as if we had
been to a funeral,” said the sergeant lugubriously,
“though it looks now as if your aunt
might get well. I wish that you had never
seen that boy, Bess. We have got to miss him
tremendously about the house.”</p>

<p>“I believe you feel worse about his going
away than I do,” said Mrs. Hardy. “I know,
I just know, Stephen, that he will come back.
He isn’t fitted for that narrow French life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
and you know he has been brought up to despise
priests. Now, if he had been going to a
city like this, or to any one that liked him”—</p>

<p>“Oh! he’ll get used to it,” said the sergeant,
“and boys forget.”</p>

<p>“Some boys do—Eugene won’t,” said Mrs.
Hardy. “I know him better than you do,
Stephen.”</p>

<p>While they were talking, their cab stopped
in front of their own door. The sergeant got
out first, and taking a key from his pocket he
inserted it in the lock. After he had swung
open the door, and let his wife pass in, he
sauntered around the garden, carrying on a
half-growling soliloquy with himself. He was
slightly out of temper, and he did not know
what he wanted.</p>

<p>The clouds of the night had all blown away,
and the morning was bright and cheerful. The
frost that for some days had held the garden-beds
in its grasp had relaxed, and they were
now soft and muddy.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said the sergeant, suddenly pausing
in his walk, “some young rascal has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
tramping over this marigold-bed by Eugene’s
window—just about the size of his foot too.
Why, what’s that?” and he wrinkled his eyebrows
as his eyes fell on the blood-stains on the
sill. “There’s something wrong here. I’ll
investigate. If I’m not a bad guesser some
one has been getting in this window. I told
Bess she ought not to leave it open; but she
would do it, and she didn’t expect the boy
to come back either. Just a woman’s foolishness.”</p>

<p>He strode quietly up to the window, and
tried to look in. The blind was down so he
could not do it; therefore he put his hands on
the sash, and softly raised it.</p>

<p>More softly than he had raised it he put it
down, and his amazed and discontented expression
vanished instantaneously. His lips formed
themselves into an exclamation of surprise; and
uttering a long, low whistle, he nimbly picked
his way over the muddy paths back to the front
of the house.</p>

<p>“Hello, Bess dear,” he said, saluting her with
an affectionate tap on the shoulder as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
whisked into view with a duster in her hand,
“you’re the prettiest woman I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Stephen, are you crazy?” she said rather
pettishly; “and why didn’t you wipe your feet?
You are tracking up my clean hall.”</p>

<p>“You’re out of sorts, Bess; you find the
house lonely without the boy.”</p>

<p>She hung her head without speaking. She
had started out with the intention of bearing
her loss bravely while it should last, and she
was not yet willing to give in.</p>

<p>“I’m hungry,” said the sergeant unexpectedly;
“can’t I have some more breakfast?”</p>

<p>In a trice her white head was held up again.
“Why, Stephen, you had your breakfast at the
railway station.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose I did—can’t I have some
more?”</p>

<p>“Oh! certainly, if you wish it,” she returned,
eyeing him in a kind of uneasy surprise; “but
you ate so much.”</p>

<p>“It’s pretty hard if a man can’t have all he
wants to eat in his own house,” said the sergeant,
and then he began to sing,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">“I can’t get ’em up,</div>
<div class="i6">I can’t get ’em up.</div>
<div class="i0">I can’t get ’em up in the morning.</div>
<div class="i6">I can’t get ’em up,</div>
<div class="i6">I can’t get ’em up,</div>
<div class="i0">I can’t get ’em up at all.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Hardy stared at him. She did not in the
least understand this sudden jocularity of mood.</p>

<p>The sergeant, nothing daunted by her expression,
allowed his spirits to rise higher and
higher, and continued,—</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">“The captain’s worse than the sergeant;</div>
<div class="i0">The sergeant’s worse than the corp’ral;</div>
<div class="i0">The corp’ral’s worse than the private;</div>
<div class="i0">But the major’s the worst of all.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>“Stephen,” said Mrs. Hardy tearfully, “I
don’t think it’s kind of you to sing that.”</p>

<p>“Why not, my dear? why not?”</p>

<p>“Because—you know why.”</p>

<p>“Because I used to sing it every morning
when the boy was here. Well, I just want
to remind you of him, to keep you from forgetting,
as it were. You think he is coming
back, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Ye-e-s,” and she reluctantly uttered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
word; “but, O Stephen! I don’t want to
wait.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t necessary. You sha’n’t wait,” vociferated
the sergeant, roaming about the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy was just about to lose her composure,
and throw herself miserably into a
chair; but at his words a puzzled, almost fearful,
expression came over her face, and in
tremulous haste she hurried to the pantry,
and busied herself in preparing the extra
meal that he had demanded.</p>

<p>“His grandfather died in a lunatic asylum,”
she murmured, as her shaking hand dropped
tea instead of coffee into the coffee-pot. “Is
it possible that his mind is getting affected?
He sha’n’t be worried into it, anyway,” she
went on, bravely dashing aside a tear; and
her fingers fairly flew, as she cut slices of
cold meat and buttered some rolls. “He
shall have what he wants.”</p>

<p>In a very few minutes the sergeant was
bidden to seat himself before his second breakfast.
“Now call the boy,” he exclaimed, “as
you always do before we get seated.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>“My dear husband, let us not refer to
him,” said Mrs. Hardy very slowly and soothingly;
“don’t you know he is not here?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go through the form, anyway,” said
the sergeant, smiting the table until the dishes
rattled. “Let’s go through with it for the
sake of old times and the times that are to
come;” and leaping up he took her hand in
his, and jogged merrily down the hall.</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you, Stephen,” said his wife,
with quiet yet increasing uneasiness; “but
don’t hurry, there’s plenty of time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s plenty of time,” whispered
her husband, and to her further anxiety he
became mysterious and subdued; “hush, now,
if he was here we might wake him;” and he
tiptoed cautiously into the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy kept close to his side, her
troubled attention riveted on him, until she
stumbled over a pair of muddy boots.</p>

<p>Then she lifted up her eyes. There on the
back of a chair was a coat with brass buttons,
and there in the white bed was a sleeping
boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>With a cry like that of a mother-bird kept
from her young she flew to the bed, and the
released and misunderstood sergeant now left
to his own devices capered clumsily about the
room.</p>

<p>When Eugene waked from sleep, and saw
the white head and eager face of his adopted
mother bending over him, his first drowsy exclamations
were in French; then he broke
into English. “Mrs. Hardy,” he cried, “I
was dreaming of you;” and he raised himself,
and threw his arms around her neck.</p>

<p>The sergeant heard his wife’s exclamation,
“My treasure! I knew you would come back.”
And he also heard Eugene’s clear, ringing
sentence, “Mother! mother! I have not said
it before, except to the king of the park, but
I will call you that now to all the world!”
At this latter assurance the sergeant’s capering
ceased, and he walked soberly to the
window.</p>

<p>“Bother these women, they are always crying,”
he observed with what he meant to be
an infinity of pity and indulgence. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and
gently touched up the corners of his eyes. A
minute later he was just about to turn around,
when he found it necessary to go through the
same operation again. For a number of times
his handkerchief went from his pocket to his
eyes, until he said with impatience, “I don’t
care if they do see me;” and marched to the
bed.</p>

<p>“Son,” he remarked, “I am glad to see
you back.”</p>

<p>Eugene was sitting up in the bed, looking
slimmer than ever in his white nightgown.
“Will you take me for your child?” he asked
wistfully. “If you will, though I am but a
pauper, I shall feel like a prince.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take you,” said the sergeant, winking
rapidly, “prince or pauper or whatever you
like to be.”</p>

<p>“I was never happy until I came to you,”
said Eugene; “and I shall never be happy
away from you—I feel that.”</p>

<p>“Boy,” said the sergeant, “it isn’t your fault
that you were a bit cantankerous. You were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
brought up wrong. I wonder the Lord lets
some people have children. They don’t know
how to train ’em, and yet it’s a hard thing to
do. I hear a lot of talk nowadays about the
perfectibility of human nature, but I don’t see
much of it in my profession. Show me a baby
boy, and I say there’s a bad one. Show me a
baby girl, and I say there’s one not quite so
bad. They’ve got to be drilled. Before I got
to be as good even as I am now, my old father
had to wallop me, and my mother had to pray
and cry over me without ceasing. We’re born
bad—that’s my doctrine; and we’re put here to
improve our natures, so that we may be fit to
live in another world by and by.”</p>

<p>“I like those words,” said Eugene thoughtfully;
“and I believe them now, though once
I would not have thought there was truth in
them.”</p>

<p>“I guess they’re sound,” said the sergeant;
“and though we’re not perfect, wife and I,
we’ll try to teach you a few good things.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I have so much to tell you,” said Eugene,
kissing Mrs. Hardy’s hands, and folding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
them to his breast, “so much. It seems a year
since I left. I must tell you of New York,
and how the poor curé was disturbed.”</p>

<p>“Get up and dress,” said the sergeant, “and
come outside and talk to us. There’s some
breakfast for you there. I looked out for
that,” and putting his arm around his wife’s
waist he drew her from the room.</p>

<p>“I’ve just fifteen minutes before I go to
the park,” he cried, “I hope the little fellow
will hurry.”</p>

<p>“He will,” said Mrs. Hardy. “Oh, thank
God that we have him back again!”</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of comfort in children,” said
the sergeant, “if you take them the right
way; and I often wonder what the state of
mind of real parents is like when a body can
get so fond of children that don’t belong to
him. Bess, we’ll try to bring that bairn up
in the right way, and when we’re gone we
won’t feel that we’ve left no one behind us
in the world.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>It is yet rather early in the day to predict
Eugene’s future, as he has only been a few
months with the Hardys.</p>

<p>He is still a pale, elegant lad with courteous
manners, and he enjoys to the full the country
life that the Hardys are now living; for the
aunt died soon after his return, and left to his
adopted parents a comfortable house situated
some miles out of Boston.</p>

<p>The sergeant has resigned from the police
force, and the city cares for the cats; though
every week the sergeant and Eugene ride in,
the former on a stately chestnut horse, and the
latter on a beautiful pony, to pay a visit to the
park, where they are eagerly welcomed by
the king and his subjects.</p>

<p>On these weekly visits Eugene often calls on
the Mannings, and is rapturously welcomed by
Virgie; but whether he goes there or not, he
never fails to seek the spot where the bust of
John Boyle O’Reilly looks toward the city.
He always remains before it for a long time.
His childish love for his emperor will never die
away; but it is broadening now, and he is taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
into his affections the heroes of his adopted
country.</p>

<p>The sergeant invariably takes him a round
of the public buildings and monuments of the
city. Eugene’s face flashes as he follows the
sergeant’s lead, and reins in his black pony near
the colossal statue of Washington on his horse,
or gazes at the noble, manly Lincoln standing
over the freed slave. He loves also the Soldiers’
and Sailors’ Monument on the Common,
where his favorite figure is the Federal infantryman
standing at ease.</p>

<p>The sergeant likes best the figure of peace on
this monument,—the woman bearing the olive-branch,
and having her eyes toward the South.</p>

<p>One day not long ago, when they were standing
before this monument, Eugene said, “I may
not be a soldier when I am grown up; but if
this country should need me, I will serve it
till I die.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” observed the sergeant, “if
you are a good honest citizen, respecting yourself
and the rights of others, and trying to keep
a clear record, you’ll be doing as good service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
in the world as if you were running about with
a sword or a gun in your hand to pick a
quarrel.”</p>

<p>“But suppose one just <i>had</i> to fight,” said the
boy earnestly, “suppose one could not get out
of it.”</p>

<p>“Get out of it, get out of it,” said the sergeant
with a chuckle, “and always get out of
it; but if you can’t, and just <i>have</i> to fight,
as you say, then fight well.”</p>

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
